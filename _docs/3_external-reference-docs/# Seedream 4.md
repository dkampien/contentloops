# Seedream 4.0 User Guide​

General Guidelines​

Seedream 4.0 supports a wide range of tasks such as text-to-image generation, image editing, reference-based generation and multi-image creation. For optimal image creation results, consider the following best practices when crafting prompts:​

1.

Clearly describe the scene using natural language​

Use coherent natural language to describe the subject + action + environment. If aesthetics matter, include descriptors ofstyle, color, lighting,or composition.​

◦

✅ Recommended: A girl in a lavish dress walking under a parasol along a tree-lined path, in the style of a Monet oil painting.​

◦

⚠️ Avoid: Girl, umbrella, tree-lined street, oil painting texture.​

2.

Specify application scenario​

If you have a specific use case, explicitly state the image purpose and type in your prompt.​

◦

✅ Recommended: Design a logo for a gaming company. The logo features a dog playing with a game controller. The company name "PITBULL" is written on it.​

◦

⚠️ Avoid: An abstract image with a dog holding a controller, and the word PITBULL on it.​

3.

Enhance stylistic rendering​

If a particular style is needed, use precise style keywords or reference images to achieve better results.​

4.

Improve text rendering accuracy​

Use double quotation marks for the text that needs to appear in the generated image.​

◦

✅ Recommended: Generate a poster with the title "Seedream 4.0".​

◦

⚠️ Avoid: Generate a poster titled Seedream 4.0.​

5.

Clearly define image editing goals and fixed elements​

Use concise, unambiguousinstructions for modifications. Avoid vague pronouns. If other elements should remain unchanged, specify that explicitly.​

◦

✅ Recommended: Dress the tallest panda in pink Peking Opera costume and headgear, keeping its pose unchanged.​

◦

⚠️ Avoid: Put that one in pink clothes.​

​

Detailed Instructions​

Text-to-Image​

Use clear and detailed natural language to describe the scene. For complex images, describe elements thoroughly to control the output precisely.​

​

⚠️ Compared to the older version Seedream 3.0, Seedream 4.0 has a stronger understanding of text prompts, allowing it to generate the expected images with less description, and the images are no longer washed out. Therefore, when using Seedream 4.0, using concise and precise prompts is usually better than repeatedly stacking ornate and complex vocabulary.​

Image-to-Image​

Seedream 4.0 supports combining text and images to perform image editing and reference-based generation tasks. Visual cues like arrows, boundingboxes and doodles can help designate specific regions within the image.​

Image Editing​

Seedream 4.0 supports image editing operations such as addition, deletion, replacement, and modification through text prompts. It is recommended to use clear and concise language to precisely indicate the target elements for editing and the specific changes required.​

​

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| \[Addition\] Add matching silver earrings and a necklaceto the girl in the image.​<br>​<br>Input Image​<br>​<br>50%<br>​<br>Result Image​<br>​<br>50% | \[Deletion\]Remove the girl's hat.​<br>​<br>Input Image​<br>​<br>50%<br>​<br>Result Image​<br>​<br>50% |
| \[Replacement\]Replace the largest bread man with a croissant man, keeping the action and expression unchanged.​<br>​<br>Input Image​<br>​<br>50%<br>​<br>Result Image​<br>​<br>50% | \[Modification\]Turn the three robots into transparent crystal, colored red, yellow and green from left to right. Make the green one run, yellow walk, red stand.​<br>​<br>Input Image​<br>​<br>50%<br>​<br>Result Image​<br>​<br>50%<br>​ |

​

​

When the image content is complex and difficult to describe accurately using text alone, visual indicators such as arrows, bounding boxes, or doodles can be used to specify the editing target and its location.​

​

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| \[Doodle\] Insert a TV where the red area is marked and a sofa where the blue area is marked. Keep the original wooden style.​<br>​<br>Input Image​<br>​<br>54%<br>​<br>Result Image​<br>​<br>46% | \[BoundingBox\] Enlarge the title to match the red boxand change its style to match the saxophone icon.​<br>​<br>Input Image​<br>​<br>50%<br>​<br>Result Image​<br>​<br>50% |

​

​

Reference-Based Generation​

Seedream 4.0 supports extracting key information from reference images, such as character design, artistic style, and product features, to enable tasks like character creation, style transfer, and product design.​

When there are specific features that need to be preserved (e.g., character identity, visual style, product design), you can upload a reference image to ensure the generated result aligns with expectations.​

When using reference images, clearly describe:​

•

Reference Target: Clearly describe the elements to be extracted and retained from the reference image, such as character design, product material from the reference image.​

•

Generated Scene Description: Provide detailed information about the desired generated content, including scene, layout, and other specifics.​

​

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| \[Reference Character\]Based on the character in the reference image, create an anime figure and place it on a desk. Behind it, place a birthday gift box printed with the character's image. Under the box, there is a book. In front of the gift box, add a round plastic base on which the figure stands. Set the scene indoors and make it as realistic as possible. The generated image should match the size of the original image. Position the figure on the left side of the image. The overall style should be consistent with the reference image, maintaining a cinematic photographic feel.​<br>​<br>Input Image​<br>​<br>50%<br>​<br>Result Image​<br>​<br>50% | \[Reference Style\]Referencing the linear minimalist style of icons, design 9 application icons for different scenarios, including: music, weather, calendar, camera, chat, map, alarm clock, shopping cart, and notebook, while maintaining a consistent color scheme.​<br>​<br>Input Image​<br>​<br>47%<br>​<br>Result Image​<br>​<br>53% |
| \[Reference Virtual Entity\] Convert the character in the picture into a felt wool figure on a small stand, placed on a dark desk.​<br>​<br>Input Image​<br>​<br>51%<br>​<br>Result Image​<br>​<br>49% | \[Reference Style\] Generate four tops in different materials and colors, based on the clothing style worn by the girl in the image. Show only the clothing.​<br>​<br>Input Image​<br>​<br>40%<br>​<br>Result Image​<br>​<br>60% |

​

​

When converting sketches (like wireframes, floor plans, hand-drawn prototypes) into high-fidelity images, we recommend the following guidelines:​

1.

Provide a clear original image. If the image contains text description, indicate "Generate based on the text in the image" in the text prompt.​

2.

Clarify the main subject and requirements, such as a high-fidelity UI interface or a modern living room.​

3.

Explicitly define key consistencies with the reference, such as ensuring that furniture placement matches the reference image and that the layout follows the prototype.​

​

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| \[Floor Plan\] Based on this floor plan, generate a photorealistic image of a "modern minimalist furnished living room + open dining area". The room layout and furniture placement should exactly match the reference. Use a Mediterranean color palette, and keep the spatial structure and orientation consistent with the example. The room should appear spacious and three-dimensional (with a sunlit double-height ceiling above the dining area). From front to back, the scene should include: sofa & green plants, television, dining table & chairs, and floor-to-ceiling windows. Do not include any text or hand-drawn edges from the original sketch.​<br>​<br>Input Image​<br>​<br>48%<br>​<br>Result Image​<br>​<br>52% | \[Hand-Drawn Prototype\] This is a hand-drawn wireframe of a web-based housing rental platform's detail page.

​

​

Multi-Image Input​

Seedream 4.0 supports multi-image inputs for composite editing such as combination, replacement, or style transfer. When using this feature, it's recommended to clearly specify what to reference or edit from each image. For example, replace the character in Image 2 with the character from Image 1, and generate the result in the style of Image 3.​

​

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| \[Replacement\] Replacethe subject in Image 1withthe subject from Image 2.​<br>​<br>Image 1​<br>​<br>35%<br>​<br>Image 2​<br>​<br>31%<br>​<br>Result Image​<br>​<br>35% | \[Combination\] Dressthe character in Image 1withthe outfit from Image 2.​<br>​<br>Image 1​<br>​<br>27%<br>​<br>Image 2​<br>​<br>47%<br>​<br>Result Image​<br>​<br>27% |

​

​

Multi-Image Output​

Seedream 4.0 supports generating image sequences with consistent character continuity and unified style, making it suitable for storyboarding, comic creation, and set-based design scenarios that require a cohesive visual identity, such as IP product design or emoji pack creation.​

When generating multiple images, you can trigger series generation with phrases like "a series", "a set", or by specifying the number of images.​
