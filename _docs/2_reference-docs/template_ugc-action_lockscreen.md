# UGC-Action Lockscreen Template Design

**Status**: In Development
**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Branch**: `template-workflows`

---

## Template Identity

**ID**: `ugc-action_lockscreen`
**Name**: UGC Action Lockscreen
**Purpose**: Generate AI-powered UGC-style videos featuring relatable everyday actions to promote BibleChat's lockscreen widget feature

**Problem Solved**: CTO's current system uses database of UGC videos with emotion mismatch issues. This template generates contextually appropriate action-focused videos on demand with implied emotional tone.

---

## Template Purpose & Outcome

**Viewer Journey**:
1. Relates to the everyday action shown
2. Connects with the text hook message
3. Prompted to try BibleChat via lockscreen widget

**Core CTA**: Add BibleChat verses to your phone's lockscreen

---

## Workflow Structure

```
Input: UserProblem { category, problem }

Step 1 (Parallel): LLM Call 1 → Video prompt for Veo
Step 2 (Parallel): LLM Call 2 → Text hook for overlay
Step 3: Veo 3.1 → Generate person video (4-6 seconds)
Step 4: ElevenLabs → Generate voiceover reading text hook
Step 5: Assembly → Video + Text overlay + Voiceover + Ambient audio
Step 6 (External): Add lockscreen asset (provided by CTO's system)

Output: Lockscreen-ready video clip
```

---

## Visual Format

### Video Specifications
```
Duration: 4-6 seconds
Aspect Ratio: 9:16 (vertical, lockscreen format)
Resolution: 720p or 1080p
Style: UGC self-filmed aesthetic
```

### Visual Requirements
```
✓ Person doing everyday action
✓ Person NOT looking at camera (focused on activity)
✓ Generic action (cooking, walking, sitting, drinking coffee)
✓ Action independent of problem (not literal problem-solving)
✓ Self-filmed aesthetic (handheld or on tripod)
✓ Natural, authentic feeling
✓ Neutral/minimal emotion (no exaggerated expressions)
```

---

## Audio Design

### Audio Layers
```
Layer 1: Ambient/action sounds from Veo (20-30% volume)
├─ Purpose: Authenticity and presence
└─ Source: Generated by Veo

Layer 2: ElevenLabs voiceover (100% volume)
├─ Purpose: Primary message delivery
├─ Reads: Text hook content
├─ Voice: Warm, empathetic, conversational (30s-40s age range)
└─ Pacing: Slow and clear for 6-second duration

Layer 3: Background music (10-15% volume, optional)
├─ Purpose: Emotional tone
└─ Style: Soft, hopeful, non-intrusive
```

---

## Content Requirements

### Generated Fields

**Video Prompt** (for Veo):
```
Components:
- person: Description (age, appearance)
- action: Specific everyday activity
- setting: Location and lighting
- props: Minimal, natural context
- filmingStyle: UGC aesthetic details

NO emotion words in prompt (causes exaggeration)
```

**Text Hook** (for overlay + voiceover):
```
Length: 12-18 words (readable in 6 seconds)
Pattern: Situational framing + Solution pointer
Style: Empathetic, not explicitly emotional
Focus: "When [situation]..." not "Feeling [emotion]..."

Example: "When finances feel overwhelming, find peace on your lockscreen"
```

---

## Key Design Principles

### Emotion Strategy
```
❌ NOT in video: No explicit emotion in Veo prompt (causes exaggeration)
❌ NOT in text: No emotion labeling ("anxious", "worried", "stressed")
✓ IMPLIED: Through situation, context, viewer projection
```

### Cohesion Strategy
```
Part 1 (Video): Universal relatability
├─ Generic everyday moment
├─ Neutral expression
└─ Viewer: "That's like me"

Part 2 (Text Hook): Specific context
├─ Names the struggle situationally
├─ Doesn't label emotions
└─ Viewer: "That's my situation"

Part 3 (Lockscreen): Solution
├─ BibleChat widget on phone
└─ Viewer: "I can try that"

Flow: Relatability → Context → Action
```

### Action-Problem Relationship
```
Decision: Generic action (NOT tied to problem)

Rationale:
- More engaging and less heavy
- Less literal/on-the-nose
- Text hook provides problem context
- Video is backdrop, hook is message
```

---

## Testing Learnings

### What Worked (2/6 success rate)
```
✓ Action-focused prompts with detailed movements
✓ Specific setting and lighting details
✓ Natural props in context
✓ Multiple action descriptions (typing, pausing, looking)
```

### What Failed
```
✗ Explicit emotion in prompts → Exaggerated expressions
✗ Too simple prompts → Generic/actionless videos
✗ Emotion + detailed action → Still exaggerated
```

### Current Challenges
```
⚠️ Veo aesthetic: Output looks too cinematic/polished/high-contrast
⚠️ Need: Raw, authentic, relatable UGC look
⚠️ Status: Unknown if achievable with better prompting
```

---

## Unresolved Questions

### 1. Veo Tool Capability
```
Question: Can Veo produce authentic UGC look?
Status: Testing needed with prompt variations
Options: Accept polished look, try prompts, or pivot to different tool
```

### 2. Exact Content Fields Structure
```
For Video Prompt:
- Structured JSON fields vs. assembled string?
- Which fields exactly?
- Assembly formula?

For Text Hook:
- Strict pattern or flexible?
- Variables for personalization?

Status: Need to finalize after Veo testing
```

### 3. Prompt Methodology
```
Need: Systematic approach to writing effective Veo prompts
- What level of detail works?
- How to describe action without emotion?
- How to get authentic UGC aesthetic?

Status: Requires training/experimentation
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Implementation)
1. ✅ Finish template design (this document)
2. ⏳ Test Veo with action-focused, no-emotion prompts
3. ⏳ Find winning Veo prompt pattern
4. ⏳ Develop prompt methodology
5. ⏳ Validate cohesion (video + hook + lockscreen flow)

### Implementation Phase
1. Design LLM system prompts (Call 1 & 2)
2. Define JSON schemas
3. Build plugin architecture
4. Integrate ElevenLabs for voiceover
5. Create assembly pipeline

## Comparison to D2C Template

| Aspect | D2C Template | UGC-Action Lockscreen Template |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Scenes** | 3 scenes (24s total) | 1 scene (4-6s) |
| **LLM Calls** | 2 sequential | 2 parallel |
| **Frame Chaining** | Yes (character consistency) | No (single clip) |
| **Assembly** | Always combines 3 scenes | No combining |
| **Emotion** | Explicit in script/prompts | Implied, not stated |
| **Person** | Looking at camera, speaking | Not looking, silent action |
| **Audio** | Veo generates dialogue | Voiceover + ambient |
| **Style** | Professional comfort video | Raw UGC aesthetic |
