## Notes on Visual Suitability

**Excellent for Comic Format:**
- Stories with clear action beats (David/Goliath, Red Sea, Jericho)
- Stories with dramatic visuals (Noah's Ark, Jonah, Lions' Den)
- Stories with scale/spectacle (Tower of Babel, Feeding 5000)

**Moderate Complexity:**
- Stories with more internal/emotional beats (Prodigal Son, Good Samaritan)
- Stories requiring careful visual storytelling

**Special Considerations:**
- Creation Story: Could be stunning with cosmic/nature visuals
- Resurrection: Needs sensitivity but very important story
