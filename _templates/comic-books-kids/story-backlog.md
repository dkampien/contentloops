## How to Use This Document

This is a **reference backlog** - not a production plan:
- Pick stories from this list (or add new ideas)
- Create story files using the template workflow
- **Naming convention:** Use numbered format `XX-story-name.md` (e.g., `05-moses-red-sea.md`)
- Add completed stories to `stories-index.md`
- This backlog can grow infinitely without cluttering the index
