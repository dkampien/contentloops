      "narration": "God came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. He saw their pride and said, 'If they can do this as one people with one language, nothing will be impossible for them.' So God confused their language, and suddenly no one could understand each other."

      "narration": "The people stopped building because they could no longer communicate or work together. They scattered across the earth, forming different nations with different languages.
