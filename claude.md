# Project: SoulStream/Bible Chat Content Generation

## Project Status

**Client:** SoulStream (Series A, 40M users, 300% YoY growth)
**Collaboration:** 3900 EUR + 200 EUR testing/month, B2B through LLC
**Phase:** Starting Phase 1 - Building an automated content generation system, then integrate into AdLoops
**Timeline:** 2-3 months for full pipeline automation


## What We're Building

### Overview
AI-powered content generation pipeline for Bible Chat (SoulStream product). Automates creation of ad creatives and in-app content, integrated with their AdLoop distribution system.

### Evolution
- Started as POC concept (Oct 2025)
- Built technical foundation (Cycles 1-4: frame chaining, manifests, automation)
- Trial period with SoulStream (1 month)
- Now: Paid client collaboration

### Currently working on
- Comicbook template that would integrate into the bigger content gen system
- The content gen system that integrates into their Adloops platform


## Project Development Workflow
1. Exploration thread (discuss, clarify, make decisions)
2. Draft PRD
3. Draft Technical Specs (with external API docs)
4. Create Implementation Plan
5. Build incrementally (cycles)

## Important Notes
- **Client Work**: This is paid collaboration with SoulStream, not a POC
- **Integration**: Content feeds into AdLoop (their automated distribution system)
- **Goal**: Support $2.5M ad spend by November ($1 cost per install = 2.5M installs)
- **Deliverables**: Incremental - functional systems each month, full automation in 2-3 months
