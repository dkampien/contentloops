      "narration": "In the cool light of morning, the garden of Eden glowed with color. Rivers sparkled, birds sang, and every tree was heavy with fruit. In the very middle of the garden stood one special tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\n\nNear that tree a serpent, smooth and bright, lay coiled on a branch. Its eyes watched the woman as she walked among the flowers. In a soft, sly voice it spoke."

      "narration": "“Did God really say you must not eat from any tree in the garden?”\n\nThe woman stepped closer and pointed toward the tree in the center. “We may eat from the trees,” she said, “but God said we must not eat from that tree, or touch it, or we will die.”\n\nThe serpent leaned toward her, eyes gleaming. “You will not surely die. God knows that when you eat it your eyes will be opened. You will be like God, knowing good and evil.”"

      "narration": "The woman looked at the fruit. It was beautiful, bright, and full. It seemed good for food and wise for the mind. Her hand trembled as she reached out. She hesitated, then plucked the fruit and brought it to her lips.\n\nShe bit into it. Juice ran down her fingers. Then she turned and held the fruit out to her husband, who stood beside her. Their eyes met in a tense, silent moment. He took the fruit and ate."

      "narration": "At once their eyes were opened. They felt a rush of strange knowledge, and then a heavy sense of shame. They looked at one another and saw their nakedness. Fear and confusion flooded their hearts.\n\nThey hurried among the trees, grabbing broad fig leaves. With shaking hands they sewed the leaves together to make coverings, hiding themselves in the very garden that had once felt only safe and good."
