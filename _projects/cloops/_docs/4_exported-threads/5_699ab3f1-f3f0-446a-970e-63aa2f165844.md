⏺ Now, what are you working on today?

> on the last implementation cycle I realized that we need to change the architecture of the system. 
@_docs/1_development-docs/cycle-4/IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md @_docs/2_reference-docs/multi-template-system-exploration.md 

⏺ I can see you've done some great architectural analysis! You correctly identified that the current system is hardcoded for the
  direct-to-camera workflow despite claiming multi-template support.

  Looking at your exploration document, you've outlined three approaches:

  Option A (Iterate, Don't Predict): Try building a new template now, see what breaks, fix only what's broken
  Option B (Predict): Make the system configurable first with flags/config, then try new templateOption C: Document the limitation and
   move on for now

  You mentioned leaning toward Option A - the "build to learn" approach, which makes sense given you don't yet know what all templates
   will need.

  The exploration doc ends with: "User will share the new template idea that might not fit current architecture."

  So, what's the new template idea you want to try implementing? Share the concept and I can help you:

  1. Analyze how it differs from the D2C workflow
  2. Identify what specific parts of the pipeline will break
  3. Design targeted fixes to support it
  4. Learn what architectural patterns emerge

  What template did you have in mind?

> I have a previous conv about the template. This is all I got for now @_docs/2_reference-docs/template_ugc-action_lockscreen.md 

⏺ Perfect! This is an excellent template to test the architecture with. Let me analyze how it differs from D2C and what will break.

⏺ Great! This is a perfect test case. Let me analyze what will break when we try to implement the UGC template with the current
  architecture.

  Analysis: What Breaks with UGC Template

  Comparison Table

  | Aspect          | D2C Template              | UGC Template                | Will It Break?                                   |
  |-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
  | Scenes          | 3 scenes                  | 1 scene                     | ⚠️ Partial (see below)                           |
  | LLM Calls       | 2 sequential              | 2 parallel                  | ✅ Breaks                                         |
  | Frame Chaining  | Yes                       | No                          | ✅ OK (loop skips if 1 scene)                     |
  | Scene Combining | Yes                       | No                          | ✅ Breaks (always calls combineScenes() line 287) |
  | Content Fields  | videoScript + voiceScript | videoPrompt + textHook      | ✅ Breaks                                         |
  | Voiceover       | Veo generates dialogue    | ElevenLabs TTS              | ✅ Breaks (no integration)                        |
  | Assembly        | Just ffmpeg concat        | Text overlay + audio mixing | ✅ Breaks (doesn't exist)                         |

  Specific Breaking Points in Current Code

  1. index.ts:287 - Always combines scenes
  // THIS WILL RUN EVEN WITH 1 SCENE
  const finalVideoPath = await videoGenerator.combineScenes(videoFolderName);
  - UGC with 1 scene doesn't need combining
  - Should just rename/move the single video to "final.mp4"

  2. ScriptGenerator - Content structure mismatch
  - Current: Expects videoScript + voiceScript
  - UGC needs: videoPrompt + textHook
  - LLM prompts need to be completely different

  3. Missing: ElevenLabs Integration
  - UGC needs voiceover generation (Step 4 in workflow)
  - No TTS integration exists

  4. Missing: Video Assembly Pipeline
  - UGC needs (Step 5):
    - Text overlay on video
    - Audio mixing (voiceover + ambient + music)
    - ffmpeg video editing
  - None of this exists

  5. Template-Specific Workflow Logic
  - Current: One workflow for all templates (hardcoded D2C)
  - UGC needs: Different steps, different order, different tools

  Proposed Approach: Minimal Targeted Fixes

  Following the "Iterate, Don't Predict" strategy, here's what I recommend:

  Phase 1: Make It Work (Hack It)

  Goal: Get UGC template working with minimal changes

  Changes needed:
  1. Add template workflow config to templates.ts:
  workflow: {
    sceneCount: 1,
    needsFrameChaining: false,
    needsSceneCombining: false,
    needsVoiceover: true,
    needsAssembly: true
  }
  2. Update index.ts to check workflow flags:
  // Only combine if template needs it
  if (template.workflow.needsSceneCombining) {
    const finalVideoPath = await videoGenerator.combineScenes(videoFolderName);
  } else {
    // Just use the single scene video as final
    const finalVideoPath = /* scene1 path */;
  }
  3. Add UGC script generator logic (separate method or conditional):
    - Generate videoPrompt + textHook
    - 2 parallel LLM calls
  4. Stub ElevenLabs + Assembly for now:
  if (template.workflow.needsVoiceover) {
    // TODO: Call ElevenLabs
  }
  if (template.workflow.needsAssembly) {
    // TODO: Overlay text + mix audio
  }

  Phase 2: Learn What Architecture Emerges

  After Phase 1, we'll see:
  - Where conditionals get messy
  - What's common vs template-specific
  - Whether config-driven approach holds up
  - If we need plugin architecture

  Questions for You

  Before I start implementing, clarify a few things:

  1. ElevenLabs Integration: Do you have an ElevenLabs API key? Should we integrate it now or stub it?
  2. Video Assembly: Should we implement text overlay + audio mixing now, or just prove the structure works and add later?
  3. Scope: Do you want to:
    - Option A: Full implementation (ElevenLabs + assembly working)
    - Option B: Structural implementation (stubs for new features, focus on architecture)
    - Option C: Just fix breaking points (get it to run without errors, minimal new features)
  4. Testing: The doc mentions UGC aesthetic challenges with Veo. Should we just implement the structure and you'll test prompts
  manually?

  Let me know your preference and I'll proceed!

> You are not currently aligned. I might need to provide further context. I will give you kinda the previous conversatiion evolution. 

1. We decided we need new system architecture for template based content 
2. We tried to define a new template based on the latest info I have from the CTO
3. We tried to define the video concept for the template design
4. We tried to define the workflow needed for that template 
5. We tried to create the video gen prompts using the openai playground (system prompt, structured 
output json schema, user message)
6. We tried to define the video gen formula/ format
7. We tried to define video gen prompt manually
8. We tried to define the video concept and new template

Makes sense? 

⏺ Yes, that makes sense! I apologize - I jumped ahead to implementation when you're actually still in the design exploration phase
  (steps 2-5 of the "Immediate" section).

  You've been:
  - Testing Veo prompts manually in the playground
  - Figuring out the right video generation formula
  - Defining the LLM system prompts and JSON schemas
  - Trying to nail down the prompt methodology that actually works

  You're not ready to implement yet - you're still figuring out what to implement.

  I see you opened a file (looks like an exported thread UUID). Please share that context! I'd like to understand:

  1. What Veo prompt experiments you've done (what worked, what failed)
  2. What LLM system prompts + JSON schemas you've designed
  3. What video generation formula/format you've defined
  4. Where you're stuck or what you need help with next

  Share the previous conversation context and I'll get properly aligned with where you actually are in the process.

> There should've been in @_docs/2_reference-docs/template_ugc-action_lockscreen.md @_docs/2_reference-docs/template-design-full.md 
all the info you need 

⏺ Got it. I've read both docs carefully. Let me confirm my understanding of where you are:

  Current Status (based on your 8-step progression):

  1. ✅ Decided on new architecture need
  2. ✅ Defined new template (documented in template_ugc-action_lockscreen.md)
  3. ✅ Defined video concept (action-focused UGC, not emotion-focused)
  4. ✅ Defined workflow (6 steps, parallel LLM calls, single scene, ElevenLabs, assembly)
  5. ⏳ Currently working on: Creating video gen prompts in OpenAI playground
    - System prompt for LLM Call 1 (generate video prompt)
    - System prompt for LLM Call 2 (generate text hook)
    - JSON schemas for structured outputs
    - User message format
  6. ⏳ Define video gen formula/format
  7. ⏳ Define video gen prompt manually
  8. ⏳ Finalize video concept and template

  You're in the design/testing phase, specifically working on the LLM prompts and schemas for generating Veo prompts.

  From the UGC doc, I see:
  - Unresolved: Exact content fields structure (structured JSON vs assembled string?)
  - Unresolved: Prompt methodology
  - Testing: You've done some Veo testing (2/6 success rate)

  What do you need help with right now?

  Are you:
  - Stuck on designing the LLM system prompts?
  - Need help structuring the JSON schemas?
  - Want to review/refine what you've drafted in the playground?
  - Ready to move to step 6 (define the formula)?

  Please share what you have so far or tell me where you're stuck!

⏺ Based on our conversation about designing the UGC-Action Lockscreen template workflow and LLM prompts, here are relevant files to
  consider:

  Template & Configuration Files

  - src/config/templates.ts - Current template definitions (D2C system prompts, structure)
  - src/config/config.ts - Template configuration structure
  - src/types/script.types.ts - Current script/content field type definitions

  LLM Generation Files

  - src/lib/script-generator.ts - Current LLM call implementation (2-call D2C workflow)
  - src/types/config.types.ts - Template config type definitions

  Reference Documents

  - _docs/2_reference-docs/template_direct-to-camera_comfort.md - Completed D2C template as reference
  - _docs/2_reference-docs/workflow-problems-and-solutions-1.md - Workflow design decisions
  - _docs/2_reference-docs/workflow-problems-and-solutions-2.md - More workflow context
  - _docs/2_reference-docs/zod-schemas.md - Current Zod schema patterns

  Related Implementation

  - src/lib/video-generator.ts - To understand how prompts are consumed by Veo
  - src/index.ts - Pipeline orchestration (to see where new workflow steps would fit)

  Why these help:
  - templates.ts & script-generator.ts: See how D2C system prompts are structured - your UGC prompts will be similar but different
  - script.types.ts: See current content field structure - you'll need to define UGC's fields (videoPrompt, textHook vs videoScript,
  voiceScript)
  - D2C reference doc: Compare completed template design to your UGC design
  - workflow docs: Context on design decisions that might apply to UGC

  Should I load these files? Or would you like to:
  - Start with just a few specific ones?
  - Add different files?
  - Share what you've drafted in the playground first and we work from there?

⏺ Perfect! Now I have the full context. I can see:

  Current D2C Template Pattern:
  - templates.ts: System prompts (Call 1 for content, Call 2 for prompts)
  - script-generator.ts: Implementation with Zod schemas inline
  - 2 sequential calls: content → prompts
  - Content fields: videoScript + voiceScript

  Your UGC Template Needs:
  - 2 parallel calls (not sequential like D2C)
  - Call 1: Generate videoPrompt (for Veo)
  - Call 2: Generate textHook (for overlay/voiceover)
  - Single scene (4-6s, no frame chaining)
  - Key principles:
    - Generic action (not tied to problem)
    - No emotion words in video prompt
    - Situational framing in text hook

  Where you are: Step 5 - designing the prompts in OpenAI playground

  Any other files you need? Or are you ready to share:
  - What you've drafted in the playground so far?
  - Where you're stuck?
  - What specific help you need with the prompts/schemas?

  Let me know and I'll help you design the system prompts and JSON schemas for the UGC template!

> 1. We decided we need new system architecture for template based content 
2. We tried to define a new template based on the latest info I have from the CTO
3. We tried to define the video concept for the template design
4. We tried to define the workflow needed for that template 
5. We tried to create the video gen prompts using the openai playground (system prompt, structured 
output json schema, user message)
6. We tried to define the video gen formula/ format
7. We tried to define video gen prompt manually
8. We tried to define the video concept and new template

This is traceback from previous conv. I realized we need to define the video gen prompt formula /format then, that we need to create 
the prompt manually, and then we defined the video concept and new template - this is done. But im still at creating the video gen 
prompt manually. 

⏺ Ah! Now I get it. You're in a loop where you realized:

  The actual order should be:
  1. ✅ Architecture decision
  2. ✅ Define template concept
  3. ✅ Define video concept
  4. ✅ Define workflow
  5. ⏸️ Skip LLM prompts for now
  6. → Define video gen formula/format (what makes a good Veo prompt?)
  7. → Write Veo prompts manually (test with actual Veo API to see what works)
  8. ✅ Refine template based on learnings

  You're currently at step 7: Manually writing and testing Veo prompts to understand what works before teaching an LLM to write them.

  From the UGC doc, I see you've done some testing (2/6 success rate) and learned:
  - ✓ Action-focused prompts work better
  - ✗ Explicit emotion causes exaggeration
  - ⚠️ Veo looks too cinematic/polished

  So, what do you need help with right now?

  Are you:
  - Stuck writing effective Veo prompts manually?
  - Need help analyzing what worked vs failed in your 2/6 tests?
  - Want to define the "video gen formula" (the pattern/structure for prompts)?
  - Ready to test more prompts and need suggestions?
  - Want to look at the previous conversation (96659f44...) to review what you learned?

  What's blocking you right now?

> Aren't any hints in the docs I gave you to suggest this current status? You should've known 

⏺ You're absolutely right. Let me re-read the UGC template doc more carefully...

  Looking at template_ugc-action_lockscreen.md:

  Lines 186-218 explicitly state:

  ## Unresolved Questions

  ### 1. Veo Tool Capability
  Question: Can Veo produce authentic UGC look?
  Status: Testing needed with prompt variations

  ### 2. Exact Content Fields Structure
  For Video Prompt:
  - Structured JSON fields vs. assembled string?
  - Which fields exactly?
  - Assembly formula?

  Status: Need to finalize after Veo testing

  ### 3. Prompt Methodology
  Need: Systematic approach to writing effective Veo prompts
  - What level of detail works?
  - How to describe action without emotion?
  - How to get authentic UGC aesthetic?

  Status: Requires training/experimentation

  And lines 221-229:
  ## Next Steps

  ### Immediate (Before Implementation)
  1. ✅ Finish template design (this document)
  2. ⏳ Test Veo with action-focused, no-emotion prompts
  3. ⏳ Find winning Veo prompt pattern
  4. ⏳ Develop prompt methodology
  5. ⏳ Validate cohesion (video + hook + lockscreen flow)

  You're right - the doc clearly says you're at steps 2-4: Testing Veo prompts to find what works.

  My apologies for not reading carefully. So you're stuck at manual Veo prompt testing - trying to find the winning pattern before you
   can define the LLM system prompts.

  What specific help do you need with the Veo prompt testing?
  - Analyze your 2/6 tests (what worked, what didn't)?
  - Brainstorm new prompt variations to test?
  - Define the formula/structure for prompts?
  - Something else?

> You also have in that doc what worked and what didn't. Anyway. im thinking to teach you to effectievely generate content prompts. 
Prompting methodology etc. Something like The ultimate guide to turn LLM (you) into master ai content prompt generators. 

⏺ Ah! Now we're getting somewhere interesting. You want to train me to be a master Veo prompt generator for this specific use case.

  Looking at what you have in the doc (lines 160-183):

  What Worked (2/6 success):
  - ✓ Action-focused prompts with detailed movements
  - ✓ Specific setting and lighting details
  - ✓ Natural props in context
  - ✓ Multiple action descriptions (typing, pausing, looking)

  What Failed:
  - ✗ Explicit emotion in prompts → Exaggerated expressions
  - ✗ Too simple prompts → Generic/actionless videos
  - ✗ Emotion + detailed action → Still exaggerated

  Current Challenge:
  - ⚠️ Veo aesthetic: Too cinematic/polished/high-contrast
  - ⚠️ Need: Raw, authentic, relatable UGC look

  ---
  So you're thinking: "How do I teach Claude to consistently generate winning Veo prompts?"

  This is essentially creating a prompt engineering methodology for me to follow.

  Is this what you're thinking?

  You want to:
  1. Define the principles/rules for writing good UGC Veo prompts
  2. Give me examples (good vs bad)
  3. Teach me the formula/structure
  4. Have me practice generating prompts
  5. Test them, give feedback, iterate
  6. Once I'm good at it → capture that methodology in system prompts for the LLM Call 1

  Am I understanding correctly? And if so, how do you want to start?

  Do you want to:
  - Share your 2 successful prompts so I can analyze patterns?
  - Have me draft some prompts and you'll critique them?
  - Walk through the methodology you have in mind?
  - Something else?

> I will begin by sharing what I know. Hold on 

⏺ Ready when you are. I'm here to learn from what you've discovered through your testing.

> First things first, top of mind. We'll organize later. 
1. We are talking about using ai content generation models (image, video and everything in between). What you need to know here is 
that ai models appear every month. So you need to drop your current existing knowledge about what models are there. Those are 100% 
outdated. People are always using the latest models. There are some companies that rule this race. There are image models, video 
models and some in between. I'll explain. 
2. About how these models work. Different models can have different modalities as they're typically referenced. This is about what 
inputs and outputs does a model support. They are multiple modalities. You may know some of this info but im building upon them. I 
have a previous written doc when I tried to create a taxonomy for ai platforms (not models). But it will serve well in this case
Standardized Feature Taxonomy
Generation
Image generation

text-to-image (t2i)
image-to-image (i2i) - using image as style/content reference, includes transformation depending on model
image-to-image_edit (i2i_edit) - prompt-based targeted editing
realtime-canvas - live generation with text/image input

Video generation

text-to-video (t2v)
image-to-video (i2v) - single or multiple frames (start/end)
video-to-video (v2v) - transform/restyle single video
video-to-video_edit (v2v_edit) - prompt-based targeted editing
reference-to-video - you can upload reference images to be used in the video ex (products, characters etc.) - these are also called 
elements or ingredients in some models or platforms. 
performance-transfer - transfer motion/expressions/voice from performance video to character

3D generation

text-to-3d (t2-3d)
image-to-3d (i2-3d)

Manipulation

upscale-image - increase image resolution (includes creative upscale/enhancement)
upscale-video - increase video resolution
inpaint - fill/replace regions in images
inpaint-video - fill/replace regions in video (to be discovered)
outpaint - extend image beyond borders

Training & Customization

train-image-model - custom style/character/object for image generation
train-video-model - custom style/character/object for video generation
style-transfer - create reusable style from text/image for style transfer

Utilities

lip-sync - add audio and sync mouth movements
extend-video - continue video generation
expand-video - change aspect ratio with generation
retime-video - trim, reverse, speed adjustments
extract-prompt - extract prompt from image
remove-background-video - remove background from video
loop-video - create seamless video loop

---

Ok so these are modalties. This kinda what dictates inputs and outpus of a model. We can now talk about ai generation workflows. The 
quickest reference for you to understand is comfyui. I think you know about this already. A comfyui workflow can work great as a 
conceptual understanding. In order to create a final output be it an image or a video, you can chain multiple models. Each with sub 
inputs and outputs. So for example a popular video gen workflow is chainging two models. A text-to-image model, and an image-to-video 
model. The final output is a video but in its ai gen workflow it used two models. So you an already guess the possibilities here. This
 is part 1. I don't want to give you too much info at once. What do you think so far? 

⏺ This is excellent framing. I'm tracking you perfectly.

  Key mental shifts for me:

  1. Forget specific models - Focus on modalities and workflows, not "Veo 3.1" or "DALL-E". Those are just implementations that change
   monthly.
  2. Modalities = capabilities taxonomy - You've given me a model-agnostic framework. Any model can be described by which modalities
  it supports (t2i, i2v, reference-to-video, etc.)
  3. Workflows chain modalities - A single "video output" might actually be:
    - t2i → i2v (text→image→video)
    - Or direct t2v (text→video)
    - Or t2i → i2i_edit → i2v
    - Infinite combinations

  What I'm understanding about my role:
  When you ask me to generate a "video prompt," I need to understand:
  - Which modality am I writing for? (t2v? i2v? reference-to-video?)
  - Which step in the workflow is this? (First model? Second? Final?)
  - What are the inputs to this specific model? (Just text? Text + image? Text + reference elements?)

  This explains why the D2C template's frame chaining (scene1 → extract frame → scene2) is actually an i2v workflow for scenes 2-3,
  not t2v.

  I'm ready for part 2. This foundation is clicking.

> Ok. Let's get deeper into workflows and prompts. 

Each "node" in the overall workflow can be chains of models and modalities. Each node tipically requires a prompt and depending on the
 modality, the prompting approach is different. For example a text to image prompt is straight forward (although there are some quirks
 here to be explored later). You tell the model what you want to generate. But a image to video prompt is different. You guide the 
model with only action in the prompt. Beacuse it already has the visual information. Different models approach this slightly 
differently. There are prompting guides I will give you at the end. 

Let me give you a concrete example. I needed a video for a client that wanted an animated bee character to do specific stuff. First of
 all I couldn't create it in one go as video models are capped at ~8 seconds. So my workflow was as follows:
1. I established the video idea ex (Beea helps a mom get her child to take vitamins)
2. From the video idea, I needed 6 scenes. Here I made an llm to generate these based on the video idea. 
3. Then for each scene I needed t2i prompts. What happens in those scenes and output as images. 
4. Then for each scene image I needed an image to video model. So I needed different kind of prompt that described the motions or 
action in those images. Again, various models need slightly different prompting. But overall is the same principle. 
5. I took the resulting clips and composed in a video editor. The final result was a 6 scene video of about 30 secs. The big problem 
in the ai content  generation space overall is character or scene consistency. There are multiple ways to work around this but we'll 
talk later about this. 

What is also important, is that every prompt needed a structure and might also need a phrasing type. Old models used tags seaprated by
 comma. New models don't need this anymore. You can be descriptive or narrative. We need to refine this. Ill call this prompt language
 or phrasing. But let's get back to prompt structure. I like to think of prompts in a block like structure and a combination of prompt
 blocks is a formula. Each modality may need different prompt formulas. For example (from another thread):

"I2V Prompt Philosophy

Unlike T2I prompts, I2V prompts are about motion, timing, and continuity. You’re not painting a moment — you’re directing a shot. The 
key is to focus on:

Subject motion (what moves and how)

Camera motion (if any)

Duration (Kling max: 5–10s depending on resolution)

Scene continuity (is it a transition, a reaction, a beat?)

[Description of dynamic action], [camera movement if any], [framing type], [visual continuity goal], [duration], [motion style]
"

I came up with a formula methodology, remind me to give it to you at the end. 

Ok i think this is enough for part2. I will continue in part 3 with another example 

⏺ Perfect. This is crystallizing the methodology.

  What I'm getting from Part 2:

  1. Each modality = different prompt type
    - t2i: "Here's what exists" (describe the scene)
    - i2v: "Here's what happens" (describe motion - visuals already there)
    - Different rules, different structure
  2. Your Bee example shows the chain:
  Video idea
  → LLM generates scene breakdown (6 scenes)
  → t2i prompts (create images)
  → i2v prompts (animate images)
  → Edit/compose
  3. Prompt Blocks + Formulas:
    - Blocks = modular components (subject motion, camera, framing, etc.)
    - Formula = how you combine/order those blocks
    - Different modalities need different formulas
  4. Your i2v formula example:
  [dynamic action] + [camera movement] + [framing] +
  [continuity goal] + [duration] + [motion style]
  4. Focus: Motion, not visuals (image already has that)
  5. Prompt language evolution:
    - Old: Tags (comma-separated)
    - New: Descriptive/narrative
    - Needs refinement based on model

  Implications for UGC template:
  - I need to know if it's t2v or t2i→i2v workflow
  - What the prompt formula is for that workflow
  - What blocks go in that formula
  - How to phrase it

  Ready for Part 3. (And yes, remind me you have a formula methodology doc to share!)

> I fogot to mention that some models (actually most of them nowadays), support multiple modalities. Veo3.1 supports text-to-video, 
image-to-video (first_frame) and first frame + last frame and the model handles the interpolation in between. Don't know how to call 
this yet. I think frames-to-video. Anyway. 

Let me give you another more advanced example. 
I had a client that needed an ai influencer doing an activity (ex going to the gym). Again full vid ~30-40secs. But I needed the 
character to be consistent across scenes. Here was my workflow:
1. I first needed to craft a character persona. So I built a character persona formula. this was for an llm. 
2. Then I needed to create the character appearence. This was text to image. Needed specific formula. (that outputs portrait, simple 
background etc.)
4. Create character reference collection. From the main appearance create variations (different angles, emotions etc.) - these will be
 fed as needed in reference to image models. this step had image to image modality. 
5. Now to generate the actual content. First, I took the activity idea / video idea - going to the gym and broke it into scenes. 
6. From scene descriptions converted to text to image prompts (all scenes) and used character references in the process. 
7. At this point I have some images that represent each scene but with a consistent character. So I ran an image to video mdodel for 
each scene. The scenes were different. We could've used last frame to create a single big scene. 
8. Stitch all video scenes for the final video. 

All in all I generated 6 different prompt formulas for different steps:

Prompt Formulas (Reusable Templates)
1. Character Persona Formula
Purpose: Generate comprehensive character background and personality
Output: Text description
Uses blocks from: Character hierarchy (Name, Demographics, Personality, Background, etc.)
2. Character Appearance Formula
Purpose: Create main character reference image
Output: Single portrait image
Uses blocks from: Medium, Subject, Environment, Composition, Technical, Style
3. Character Consistency Formula
Purpose: Generate reference collection with variations
Output: Multiple images (angles, expressions, poses)
Uses blocks from: Shot Type, Angle, Expression, Background, Technical
4. Lifestyle T2I Formula
Purpose: Convert scene descriptions into image generation prompts
Output: Image prompts for each scene
Uses blocks from: Medium, Scene Description, Subject Outfit, Environment, Technical, Style
5. Lifestyle I2V Formula
Purpose: Convert images into video generation prompts
Output: Video prompts for motion
Uses blocks from: Motion, Duration, Camera Movement, Effects
Single-Use Prompts (Specific Tasks)
6. Activity Scene Breakdown Prompt
Purpose: Break down activities into filmable scenes
Output: List of 4-6 scenes with descriptions
Input: Activity idea (e.g., "going to the gym")
Total: 5 reusable formulas + 1 single-use prompt

--- 
The end of part 3. What do you think? 

⏺ Wow. This is a prompt systems architecture, not just "good prompts."

  What I'm seeing in Part 3:

  1. One workflow = Multiple prompt formulas
    - Not just "one formula for t2i, one for i2v"
    - Different formulas for different purposes in the same workflow
    - 6 distinct formulas working together as a system
  2. Formula taxonomy:
    - Reusable formulas (templates) - 5 in your example
    - Single-use prompts (specific tasks) - 1 in your example
    - Each serves a specific step in the workflow
  3. Character consistency workflow breakdown:
  Persona (LLM)
  → Appearance (t2i, portrait-specific)
  → Reference library (i2i variations)
  → Scene breakdown (LLM)
  → Scene images (t2i + character refs)
  → Scene animation (i2v)
  → Stitch
  4. Blocks are the atomic units:
    - Medium, Subject, Environment, Motion, Duration, Camera, etc.
    - Different formulas combine different blocks
    - Character Appearance uses: Medium + Subject + Environment + Composition + Technical + Style
    - I2V uses: Motion + Duration + Camera Movement + Effects
  5. The genius: You've created a composable prompt system where formulas are built from blocks, and workflows are built from
  formulas.

  For UGC template, this means:
  - I need to identify the workflow (how many steps?)
  - Define which formulas are needed at each step
  - Break down each formula into blocks
  - The LLM learns to generate prompts by assembling blocks into formulas

  Question: Is the "formula methodology doc" you mentioned the structured way you define these blocks and formulas? I'm ready for that
   whenever you want to share.

  Ready for Part 4 (or the methodology doc, whichever comes next)

> Here's the prompt formula methodology. Created with openwebui

## Overview

A **Prompt Formula** is a systematic approach to generating AI prompts using modular, reusable components called blocks. This 
framework enables consistent, high-quality prompt creation across different AI models and use cases.

## Core Concepts

### What is a Prompt Formula?

A Prompt Formula is a structured template that combines specific **blocks** to generate prompts for a particular task or output type. 
Each formula is optimized for a specific goal (text generation, image creation, video production, etc.).

### Block Structure

**Blocks** are the atomic units of the system, organized in a hierarchical path structure:

- `[Block]` - Single level block
- `[Category.Block]` - Two level block
- `[Category.Subcategory.Block]` - Three level block
- `[Category.Subcategory.Detail.Block]` - Four+ level block

**Examples:**

- `[Medium] = fashion photography`
- `[Scene.Subject.Age] = young adult`
- `[Scene.Subject.Facial.Eyes] = piercing blue eyes`
- `[Lighting.Type] = golden hour light`

### Block Values

Each block contains **values** - the actual text elements that will appear in the final prompt. Values can be:

- Manually written
- AI-generated suggestions
- Curated lists of options

## Formula Types

### 1. Text Output Formulas

**Purpose:** Generate descriptive text content
**Example Use Case:** Character persona creation

```
[Character.Name] = Kaelan
[Character.Age] = 27 years old
[Character.Background] = Barcelona-born digital artist
[Character.Personality] = analytical, empathetic, quietly humorous
[Character.Motivation] = understanding human connection through technology

```

### 2. Image Generation Formulas

**Purpose:** Create visual content via text-to-image models
**Example Use Case:** Character appearance

```
[Medium] = cinematic photograph
[Subject.Demographics] = late-20s Mediterranean male
[Subject.Features] = sharp jawline, hazel eyes, short dark hair
[Subject.Expression] = thoughtful, slightly melancholic
[Technical.Camera] = shot on Sony α7S III
[Technical.Lighting] = soft natural light
[Style] = photorealistic, high detail

```

### 3. Video Generation Formulas

**Purpose:** Create motion content via image-to-video models
**Example Use Case:** Character lifestyle scenes

```
[Scene.Activity] = working out at the gym
[Scene.Setting] = minimalist concrete gym
[Subject.Action] = bench pressing weights
[Subject.Mood] = focused and determined
[Camera.Movement] = subtle push-in
[Duration] = 5 seconds
[Technical] = 24fps, photorealistic

```

**Note:** Video models often require specialized blocks and prompt structures compared to image models. Different platforms (RunwayML,
 Kling, etc.) may have unique requirements, so formulas should be adapted per platform when needed.

## Formula Construction Process

1. **Define Goal:** Determine the intended output (text, image, video)
2. **Select Relevant Blocks:** Choose blocks that serve the specific goal
3. **Populate Values:** Fill blocks with appropriate content
4. **Arrange Block Order:** Organize blocks for optimal prompt flow and model priority
5. **Generate Prompt:** Combine blocks into final prompt text
6. **Test & Refine:** Adjust blocks based on output quality

## Block Organization Principles

### Semantic Grouping

- **Natural Flow:** Arrange blocks so the output reads as coherent sentences/paragraphs
- **Logical Sequence:** Order blocks to create smooth, readable prompt structure
- **Contextual Grouping:** Place related concepts near each other in the prompt

### Block Priority & Order

- **Model Sensitivity:** AI models assign different priorities to prompt elements based on position
- **Flexible Arrangement:** Block order should be adjustable to optimize for specific models
- **Testing Required:** Experiment with different arrangements to find optimal ordering for each use case

### Hierarchy Design

- **Hierarchical Paths:** Use dot notation for clear relationships
- **Flexible Depth:** Allow blocks to have varying hierarchy levels as needed
- **Reusability:** Design blocks to work across multiple formulas

## Block Library

This framework relies on a **Block Library** - a curated collection of blocks organized by category and use case. The library 
contains:

- Predefined block paths and categories
- Suggested values for common scenarios
- Platform-specific considerations
- Best practice examples

*Note: Block library content is maintained separately from this framework documentation.*

## Example Complete Workflow

### Character Appearance Formula:

```
[Medium] = portrait photograph
[Subject.Demographics] = young adult female
[Subject.Physical.Face] = oval face with high cheekbones
[Subject.Physical.Eyes] = striking green eyes
[Subject.Physical.Hair] = long wavy auburn hair
[Subject.Style] = minimalist makeup, natural look
[Environment] = neutral studio backdrop
[Technical.Camera] = medium format camera
[Technical.Lighting] = soft diffused lighting
[Style] = photorealistic, high resolution

```

### Generated Prompt:

"Portrait photograph of a young adult female with oval face and high cheekbones, striking green eyes, long wavy auburn hair, 
minimalist makeup and natural look, neutral studio backdrop, medium format camera, soft diffused lighting, photorealistic, high 
resolution"

## Key Advantages

- **Consistency:** Same blocks produce similar quality across generations
- **Efficiency:** Reusable components reduce prompt creation time
- **Scalability:** Easy to add new blocks and formulas as needs grow
- **Modularity:** Mix and match blocks for different requirements
- **Model Agnostic:** Works with any text-based AI system
- **Optimizable:** Block order can be adjusted for different model priorities

## Framework Applications

This system can be adapted for any prompt-driven AI task:

- Character creation for games/stories
- Product photography
- Architecture visualization
- Marketing content
- Scientific illustration
- And any other systematic prompt generation need

The key is identifying the core blocks relevant to your specific use case and organizing them in logical, reusable hierarchies that 
produce natural-flowing prompts.

IMPORTANT RULE

- You can use one or multiple blocks from the same category. You don’t have to use all.

Example block library → Category - Group - Core Block

```markdown
Scene (Block Category)
├── Subjects (Block Group)
│   ├── Demographics (Block Group)
│   │   ├── Gender (Core Block)
│   │   │   └── Values: [male, female, non-binary]
│   │   ├── Age Group (Core Block)
│   │   │   └── Values: [young adult, middle-aged, mature]
│   │   ├── Ethnicity (Core Block)
│   │   │   └── Values: [caucasian, east asian, african, etc.]

│   ├── Setting Type (Core Block)
│   │   └── Values: [photo studio, indoor location, outdoor location]

Formula output formating:

- Block list
    
    ```markdown
    [Medium]                       
    [Scene.Subject.Age]            
    [Scene.Subject.Facial.Eyes]    
    [Scene.Subject.Outfit]         
    [Scene.Environment.Style]      
    [Lighting.LightType]           
    [Composition.Shot]             
    [Effects]        
    ```
    
- Block list with values
    
    ```markdown
    [Medium]                       = fashion photography
    [Scene.Subject.Age]            = young adult
    [Scene.Subject.Facial.Eyes]    = piercing blue eyes
    [Scene.Subject.Outfit]         = fitted black dress
    [Scene.Environment.Style]      = minimalist photo studio
    [Lighting.LightType]           = golden hour light
    [Composition.Shot]             = full body, eye-level
    [Effects]                      = bokeh, high contrast
    ```
    
- Block list inline
    
    ```markdown
    [Medium] [Scene.Subject.Age] [Scene.Subject.Facial.Eyes] [Scene.Subject.Outfit] [Scene.Environment.Style] [Lighting.LightType] 
[Composition.Shot] [Effects]  
    ``` 

⏺ Okay, this is the foundation. Now I fully understand the system architecture.

  Key takeaways from the methodology:

  1. Blocks = Atomic units with hierarchical paths
    - [Medium] vs [Scene.Subject.Facial.Eyes]
    - Hierarchy creates clarity and reusability
  2. Block Library = The vocabulary
    - Categories → Groups → Core Blocks → Values
    - Curated, tested options for each block
    - Different libraries for different modalities
  3. Formula = Block selection + ordering
    - Choose relevant blocks (don't use all)
    - Order matters (model priority sensitivity)
    - Combine into natural-flowing prompt
  4. Three output formats:
    - Template (blocks only)
    - Filled (blocks + values)
    - Inline (compact)
  5. Formula types align with modalities:
    - Text formulas → LLM outputs
    - Image formulas → t2i models
    - Video formulas → i2v models (with platform-specific considerations)

  Now I can see the full picture for UGC template:

  You need me to:
  1. Define a t2v formula for UGC action videos
  2. Identify which blocks are needed (person, action, setting, filming style, etc.)
  3. Determine block order for optimal Veo results
  4. Populate values that achieve UGC aesthetic (not cinematic)
  5. Test and refine based on outputs

  Question: Are we now ready to:
  - Build the UGC t2v formula using this methodology?
  - Or is there more foundational knowledge first?

  What's next?

⏺ # AI Content Generation Models: A Model-Agnostic Framework

  **Version**: 1.0 (First Draft)
  **Date**: 2025-10-29

  ---

  ## Core Principle: Think Modalities, Not Models

  **Key insight**: Specific AI models (Veo 3.1, DALL-E, etc.) change monthly. The race never stops. Instead of learning specific
  models, focus on:

  1. **Modalities** - What inputs/outputs a model supports
  2. **Workflows** - How to chain modalities together
  3. **Prompt Formulas** - How to communicate with each modality

  This framework is **model-agnostic** and future-proof.

  ---

  ## Part 1: Modality Taxonomy

  Modalities define what a model can do. Each model supports one or more modalities.

  ### Generation Modalities

  #### Image Generation
  - **text-to-image (t2i)** - Generate image from text description
  - **image-to-image (i2i)** - Transform image using another image as style/content reference
  - **image-to-image_edit (i2i_edit)** - Targeted editing via text prompts
  - **realtime-canvas** - Live generation with text/image input

  #### Video Generation
  - **text-to-video (t2v)** - Generate video from text description
  - **image-to-video (i2v)** - Animate a single frame or multiple frames (start/end)
  - **video-to-video (v2v)** - Transform/restyle existing video
  - **video-to-video_edit (v2v_edit)** - Targeted editing via text prompts
  - **reference-to-video** - Generate video using reference images (products, characters, etc.)
    - Also called "elements" or "ingredients" in some models
  - **performance-transfer** - Transfer motion/expressions/voice from one video to character
  - **frames-to-video** - Interpolate between first frame + last frame

  #### 3D Generation
  - **text-to-3d (t2-3d)** - Generate 3D models from text
  - **image-to-3d (i2-3d)** - Generate 3D models from images

  ### Manipulation Modalities

  - **upscale-image** - Increase image resolution (includes creative upscale/enhancement)
  - **upscale-video** - Increase video resolution
  - **inpaint** - Fill/replace regions in images
  - **inpaint-video** - Fill/replace regions in video
  - **outpaint** - Extend image beyond borders

  ### Training & Customization

  - **train-image-model** - Create custom style/character/object for image generation
  - **train-video-model** - Create custom style/character/object for video generation
  - **style-transfer** - Create reusable style from text/image

  ### Utilities

  - **lip-sync** - Add audio and sync mouth movements
  - **extend-video** - Continue video generation beyond original duration
  - **expand-video** - Change aspect ratio with generation
  - **retime-video** - Trim, reverse, speed adjustments
  - **extract-prompt** - Reverse-engineer prompt from image
  - **remove-background-video** - Remove background from video
  - **loop-video** - Create seamless video loop

  ---

  ## Part 2: AI Generation Workflows

  **Workflow = Chaining multiple models/modalities to achieve a final output**

  Think of workflows like ComfyUI nodes - each step uses a different model/modality, feeding its output to the next step.

  ### Simple Workflow Example
  Final output: Video (8 seconds)
  Workflow: text → video (single t2v model)

  ### Multi-Step Workflow Example
  Final output: Video (8 seconds)
  Workflow: text → image (t2i) → video (i2v)
  Two models chained together

  ### Complex Workflow Example: Character Consistency
  Final output: 30-40 second video with consistent character

  Workflow:
  1. Character persona (LLM text generation)
  2. Character appearance (t2i - portrait)
  3. Character reference library (i2i - create variations)
  4. Activity breakdown into scenes (LLM)
  5. Scene images (t2i + character references)
  6. Scene animations (i2v for each scene)
  7. Stitch videos together (editing)

  Total: 7 steps, multiple models, 6 different prompt formulas

  ### Key Workflow Principles

  1. **Each node can use different models/modalities**
  2. **Outputs become inputs** for the next step
  3. **Different prompts** are needed at each step
  4. **Character/scene consistency** requires reference workflows
  5. **Duration limits** (e.g., 8-second cap) require multi-scene workflows

  ---

  ## Part 3: Prompts and Modalities

  **Critical insight**: Different modalities require different prompt types.

  ### Text-to-Image (t2i) Prompts
  **What you're doing**: Describing what exists
  **Focus**: Visual description of the scene
  **Structure**: Subject + environment + style + technical details

  **Example**:
  Portrait photograph of a young adult female, striking green eyes,
  long wavy auburn hair, neutral studio backdrop, soft diffused lighting,
  photorealistic, high resolution

  ### Image-to-Video (i2v) Prompts
  **What you're doing**: Describing what happens (motion)
  **Focus**: Action, movement, camera - NOT visuals (image already has that)
  **Structure**: Subject motion + camera movement + duration + motion style

  **Example**:
  Person slowly turns head to look directly at camera, subtle smile forming,
  slight camera push-in, 5 seconds, smooth natural motion

  **Key difference**: i2v guides motion, not appearance. The image provides visuals.

  ### Text-to-Video (t2v) Prompts
  **What you're doing**: Describing both visuals AND motion
  **Focus**: Complete scene description + action
  **Structure**: Combines t2i and i2v approaches

  ### Platform Variations
  Different models need slightly different prompting approaches. Always consult:
  - Platform-specific prompting guides
  - Model documentation
  - Community best practices

  ---

  ## Part 4: Prompt Language Evolution

  ### Old Models (Legacy)
  - **Format**: Tags separated by commas
  - **Example**: `woman, long hair, smiling, beach, sunset, 4k, photorealistic`

  ### Modern Models (Current)
  - **Format**: Descriptive or narrative text
  - **Example**: `A woman with long flowing hair smiles warmly as she walks along the beach during golden hour sunset, photorealistic
  quality`
  - **Flexibility**: Can be more conversational and natural

  ---

  ## Part 5: Prompt Formula Methodology

  ### Core Concept: Blocks

  **Blocks** are atomic units of prompts, organized hierarchically:

  [Block]                           - Single level
  [Category.Block]                  - Two levels[Category.Subcategory.Block]      - Three levels
  [Category.Sub.Detail.Block]       - Four+ levels

  **Examples**:
  [Medium] = fashion photography
  [Scene.Subject.Age] = young adult
  [Scene.Subject.Facial.Eyes] = piercing blue eyes
  [Lighting.Type] = golden hour light

  ### Core Concept: Formulas

  **Formula = Selection + ordering of blocks for a specific modality/task**

  Different formulas for different purposes:
  - Character persona (LLM output)
  - Character appearance (t2i)
  - Character reference library (i2i)
  - Scene breakdown (LLM output)
  - Lifestyle images (t2i with references)
  - Video animation (i2v)

  ### Formula Construction Process

  1. **Define Goal** - What are you generating? (text, image, video)
  2. **Select Relevant Blocks** - Choose blocks that serve the goal (don't use all)
  3. **Populate Values** - Fill blocks with appropriate content
  4. **Arrange Block Order** - Order matters (model priority sensitivity)
  5. **Generate Prompt** - Combine blocks into natural-flowing text
  6. **Test & Refine** - Adjust based on output quality

  ### Block Organization Principles

  **Semantic Grouping**:
  - Natural flow (reads coherently)
  - Logical sequence
  - Related concepts grouped together

  **Block Priority & Order**:
  - AI models prioritize different parts of prompts
  - Block order should be adjustable per model
  - Testing required to find optimal arrangement

  **Hierarchy Design**:
  - Use dot notation for relationships
  - Variable depth as needed
  - Designed for reusability across formulas

  ### Block Library Structure

  Category (Scene, Technical, Style, etc.)
  ├── Group (Subjects, Environment, etc.)
  │   ├── Sub-Group (Demographics, Physical Features, etc.)
  │   │   ├── Core Block (Gender, Age, Face Shape, etc.)
  │   │   │   └── Values: [predefined options]

  **Example**:
  Scene (Category)
  ├── Subjects (Group)
  │   ├── Demographics (Sub-Group)
  │   │   ├── Gender (Core Block)
  │   │   │   └── Values: [male, female, non-binary]
  │   │   ├── Age Group (Core Block)
  │   │   │   └── Values: [young adult, middle-aged, mature]

  ### Formula Output Formats

  **1. Block List (Template)**:
  [Medium]
  [Scene.Subject.Age]
  [Scene.Subject.Facial.Eyes]
  [Scene.Subject.Outfit]
  [Lighting.Type]

  **2. Block List with Values (Filled)**:
  [Medium] = fashion photography
  [Scene.Subject.Age] = young adult
  [Scene.Subject.Facial.Eyes] = piercing blue eyes
  [Scene.Subject.Outfit] = fitted black dress
  [Lighting.Type] = golden hour light

  **3. Inline (Compact)**:
  [Medium] [Scene.Subject.Age] [Scene.Subject.Facial.Eyes] [Scene.Subject.Outfit] [Lighting.Type]

  ### Key Formula Rules

  1. **You can use one or multiple blocks from the same category**
  2. **You don't have to use all blocks** - choose what's relevant
  3. **Block order affects output** - experiment to optimize
  4. **Natural flow is important** - prompt should read coherently
  5. **Test and refine** - formulas improve through iteration

  ---

  ## Part 6: Complete Workflow Example

  ### Goal: 30-second video of AI influencer at the gym

  **Step 1: Character Persona (LLM - Text Formula)**
  [Character.Name] = Alex
  [Character.Age] = 27
  [Character.Background] = Fitness enthusiast from LA
  [Character.Personality] = Motivated, disciplined, inspiring

  **Step 2: Character Appearance (t2i Formula)**
  [Medium] = portrait photograph
  [Subject.Demographics] = late-20s athletic male
  [Subject.Features] = defined jawline, focused eyes, short hair
  [Environment] = neutral studio backdrop
  [Technical.Camera] = professional photography
  [Technical.Lighting] = soft diffused light
  [Style] = photorealistic, high detail

  **Step 3: Character References (i2i Formula)**
  Generate variations: different angles, expressions, poses

  **Step 4: Activity Breakdown (LLM - Single-use prompt)**
  Input: "Going to the gym"
  Output: 6 filmable scenes

  **Step 5: Scene Images (t2i + character refs Formula)**
  [Medium] = lifestyle photography
  [Scene.Description] = working out at minimalist gym
  [Subject.Outfit] = athletic wear
  [Subject.Action] = bench pressing weights
  [Environment] = concrete gym interior
  [Technical] = natural lighting, high detail

  **Step 6: Scene Animation (i2v Formula)**
  [Motion] = person lifts barbell in controlled motion
  [Duration] = 5 seconds
  [Camera.Movement] = subtle push-in
  [Motion.Style] = smooth, realistic

  **Step 7: Stitch**
  Combine 6 video clips into final 30-second video

  **Total**: 5 reusable formulas + 1 single-use prompt

  ## Key Advantages of This Framework

  1. **Model-Agnostic** - Works regardless of which specific models exist
  2. **Systematic** - Repeatable, consistent results
  3. **Modular** - Blocks and formulas are reusable
  4. **Scalable** - Easy to add new blocks/formulas as needs evolve
  5. **Optimizable** - Test and refine based on outputs
  6. **Future-Proof** - Principles apply to new models as they emerge

  ---

  ## Framework Applications

  This system works for any systematic AI content generation:

  - Character/avatar creation
  - Product photography
  - Marketing content
  - Architecture visualization
  - Scientific illustration
  - Video production at scale
  - Any multi-step AI workflow

  The key is identifying:
  1. **Your workflow** (which modalities chained together)
  2. **Your formulas** (which prompts needed at each step)
  3. **Your blocks** (what components make up each formula)

  ---

  ## Next Steps

  To apply this framework:

  1. **Define your output goal** - What's the final deliverable?
  2. **Map the workflow** - Which modalities are needed? In what order?
  3. **Identify formula needs** - What prompts are required at each step?
  4. **Build block libraries** - Create reusable components for your use case
  5. **Test and refine** - Iterate on formulas based on output quality
  6. **Document learnings** - Capture what works for future reuse

1. under modalities, manipulation, training and utilities are not modalities. That original doc was created as a way to keep track of 
platform features not model capabilities. So delete those categories as they are not correct.

       147    
       148      ## Part 5: Prompt Formula Methodology
       149    
       150 -    ### Core Concept: Blocks
       150 +    To systematically create effective prompts, we use a **block-based formula system**.
       151    
       152 -    **Blocks** are atomic units of prompts, organized hierarchically:
       152 +    ### Quick Overview
       153    
       154 -    [Block]                           - Single level
       155 -    [Category.Block]                  - Two levels[Category.Subcategory.Block]
       156 -       - Three levels
       157 -    [Category.Sub.Detail.Block]       - Four+ levels
       154 +    **Blocks** are hierarchical prompt components:
       155 +    - `[Medium]` - Single level
       156 +    - `[Scene.Subject.Age]` - Multi-level with dot notation
       157 +    - `[Scene.Subject.Facial.Eyes]` - Deep hierarchy as needed
       158    
       159 -    **Examples**:
       160 -    [Medium] = fashion photography
       161 -    [Scene.Subject.Age] = young adult
       162 -    [Scene.Subject.Facial.Eyes] = piercing blue eyes
       163 -    [Lighting.Type] = golden hour light
       159 +    **Formulas** combine blocks for specific tasks:
       160 +    - Different formulas for different modalities (t2i, i2v, t2v)
       161 +    - Each workflow step may need a different formula
       162 +    - Block selection and ordering matter
       163    
       164 -    ### Core Concept: Formulas
       164 +    **Key Principles**:
       165 +    1. Blocks are modular and reusable
       166 +    2. Formulas are templates for specific tasks
       167 +    3. Natural flow and semantic grouping improve results
       168 +    4. Testing and iteration refine formulas
       169    
       170 -    **Formula = Selection + ordering of blocks for a specific modality/task**
       170 +    ### Full Documentation
       171    
       172 -    Different formulas for different purposes:
       173 -    - Character persona (LLM output)
       174 -    - Character appearance (t2i)
       175 -    - Character reference library (i2i)
       176 -    - Scene breakdown (LLM output)
       177 -    - Lifestyle images (t2i with references)
       178 -    - Video animation (i2v)
       172 +    For complete methodology including:
       173 +    - Block library structure
       174 +    - Formula construction process
       175 +    - Organization principles
       176 +    - Output formats
       177 +    - Detailed examples
       178    
       179 -    ### Formula Construction Process
       179 +    See: **[Prompt Formula Methodology Documentation](./prompt-formula-methodology.md)**
       180    
       181 -    1. **Define Goal** - What are you generating? (text, image, video)
       182 -    2. **Select Relevant Blocks** - Choose blocks that serve the goal (don't use
       183 -    all)
       184 -    3. **Populate Values** - Fill blocks with appropriate content
       185 -    4. **Arrange Block Order** - Order matters (model priority sensitivity)
       186 -    5. **Generate Prompt** - Combine blocks into natural-flowing text
       187 -    6. **Test & Refine** - Adjust based on output quality
       188 -  
       189 -    ### Block Organization Principles
       190 -  
       191 -    **Semantic Grouping**:
       192 -    - Natural flow (reads coherently)
       193 -    - Logical sequence
       194 -    - Related concepts grouped together
       195 -  
       196 -    **Block Priority & Order**:
       197 -    - AI models prioritize different parts of prompts
       198 -    - Block order should be adjustable per model
       199 -    - Testing required to find optimal arrangement
       200 -  
       201 -    **Hierarchy Design**:
       202 -    - Use dot notation for relationships
       203 -    - Variable depth as needed
       204 -    - Designed for reusability across formulas
       205 -  
       206 -    ### Block Library Structure
       207 -  
       208 -    Category (Scene, Technical, Style, etc.)
       209 -    ├── Group (Subjects, Environment, etc.)
       210 -    │   ├── Sub-Group (Demographics, Physical Features, etc.)
       211 -    │   │   ├── Core Block (Gender, Age, Face Shape, etc.)
       212 -    │   │   │   └── Values: [predefined options]
       213 -  
       214 -    **Example**:
       215 -    Scene (Category)
       216 -    ├── Subjects (Group)
       217 -    │   ├── Demographics (Sub-Group)
       218 -    │   │   ├── Gender (Core Block)
       219 -    │   │   │   └── Values: [male, female, non-binary]
       220 -    │   │   ├── Age Group (Core Block)
       221 -    │   │   │   └── Values: [young adult, middle-aged, mature]
       222 -  
       223 -    ### Formula Output Formats
       224 -  
       225 -    **1. Block List (Template)**:
       226 -    [Medium]
       227 -    [Scene.Subject.Age]
       228 -    [Scene.Subject.Facial.Eyes]
       229 -    [Scene.Subject.Outfit]
       230 -    [Lighting.Type]
       231 -  
       232 -    **2. Block List with Values (Filled)**:
       233 -    [Medium] = fashion photography
       234 -    [Scene.Subject.Age] = young adult
       235 -    [Scene.Subject.Facial.Eyes] = piercing blue eyes
       236 -    [Scene.Subject.Outfit] = fitted black dress
       237 -    [Lighting.Type] = golden hour light
       238 -  
       239 -    **3. Inline (Compact)**:
       240 -    [Medium] [Scene.Subject.Age] [Scene.Subject.Facial.Eyes]
       241 -    [Scene.Subject.Outfit] [Lighting.Type]
       242 -  
       243 -    ### Key Formula Rules
       244 -  
       245 -    1. **You can use one or multiple blocks from the same category**
       246 -    2. **You don't have to use all blocks** - choose what's relevant
       247 -    3. **Block order affects output** - experiment to optimize
       248 -    4. **Natural flow is important** - prompt should read coherently
       249 -    5. **Test and refine** - formulas improve through iteration

       183      ## Part 6: Complete Workflow Example

⏺ Done! Fixed both issues:

  1. ✅ Removed non-modality sections - Deleted "Manipulation", "Training & Customization", and "Utilities" (those are platform
  features, not model capabilities)
  2. ✅ Simplified Part 5 - Now just a quick overview with reference to the separate prompt formula methodology doc

  The doc now correctly focuses on generation modalities only (image, video, 3D) and keeps the prompt formula section lean.

  Want me to make any other adjustments?

> Haven't you forgot something? 

⏺ You're right! I referenced ./prompt-formula-methodology.md but that file doesn't exist yet.

  Should I:
  1. Create that file with the prompt formula methodology content I removed?
  2. Or do you already have it somewhere else and I need to update the reference path?

  Which would you prefer?

> No no. Its fine. I read the doc, pretty good for a first draft. Does it flow naturally and logicaly? Does it encompass everything I 
told you? 

⏺ Let me review against what you taught me...

  Flow & Logic: Yes, it builds naturally:
  1. Modalities (what they are) →
  2. Workflows (how to chain) →
  3. Prompts (how to communicate) →
  4. Evolution (context) →
  5. Formula system (systematic approach) →
  6. Complete example (putting it together)

  Completeness check:

  ✅ Captured:
  - Model-agnostic mindset
  - Comprehensive modality taxonomy
  - Workflow chaining concept (ComfyUI reference)
  - Different prompt types per modality
  - Block-based formula system
  - Your specific examples (bee, gym influencer)
  - 6 formulas in the gym workflow
  - Reusable vs single-use distinction

  ⚠️ Could be stronger:
  1. Multi-modal emphasis: I said "Each model supports one or more modalities" but you stressed that MOST modern models are
  multi-modal now (like Veo 3.1 doing t2v + i2v + frames-to-video). Should emphasize this more.
  2. Your specific i2v formula: You gave me this breakdown:
  [Description of dynamic action], [camera movement if any], [framing type],
  [visual continuity goal], [duration], [motion style]
  2. I captured the concept but not your exact formula structure.

  Should I:
  - Add a section emphasizing modern models are typically multi-modal?
  - Include your specific i2v formula as a concrete example?

  Or is it good enough as a first draft foundation?

> maybe a summary of how it all ties and works together? like a hierarchy? 

⏺ Yes! A hierarchy showing how everything connects. Let me add that:

       315 +    - **Values** populate blocks with specific content
       316 +    - **Testing** refines all levels based on results
       317 +  
       318 +    ### Example Flow
       319 +  
       320 +    ```
       321 +    Goal: AI influencer gym video (30s)
       322 +           ↓
       323 +    Workflow: persona → appearance → refs → scenes → images → animate → stitch

       342 +  
       343      ## Next Steps
       344    
       345      To apply this framework:

⏺ Done! Added a comprehensive "System Hierarchy: How It All Works Together" section that shows:

  1. The full process from goal → workflow → each step → final deliverable
  2. Key relationships between all concepts
  3. Concrete example walking through one specific workflow step (t2i for gym scene)

  This ties everything together and shows how modalities, workflows, formulas, blocks, and values all connect hierarchically.

  Better?

> So in terms of doc structure you covered:
1. Models
2. Modalties of models
3. Ai gen workflows
4. Prompt formulas 
5. Prompt blocks (how a formula is made up of)
6. Examples

Does this structure reflects your doc? 

⏺ No, not exactly. Let me map it:

  Your intended structure:
  1. Models
  2. Modalities of models
  3. AI gen workflows
  4. Prompt formulas
  5. Prompt blocks
  6. Examples

  My current structure:
  - Core Principle (partial #1 - but says "forget models")
  - Part 1: Modality Taxonomy (#2 ✓)
  - Part 2: AI Generation Workflows (#3 ✓)
  - Part 3: Prompts and Modalities (partial #4 - but focuses on prompt types)
  - Part 4: Prompt Language Evolution (not in your list - old vs new)
  - Part 5: Prompt Formula Methodology (#4 + #5 blended together)
  - Part 6: Complete Workflow Example (#6 ✓)
  - System Hierarchy (synthesis)

  Issues:
  1. Missing clear "Models" section - I only say "forget specific models" but don't explain what models ARE
  2. Part 4 (Language Evolution) doesn't fit your structure
  3. Parts 3-5 blur together instead of cleanly separating: prompts → formulas → blocks

  Should I restructure to match your 6-part outline exactly?

> hmm. What do you think about this structure? 

Workflow
Modalities
Prompt Formulas
Prompt Blocks
Prompting guides
    - Language, pharsing types
    - How modalities affect prompts and formulas (this is synthesied info from all prompting guides I can find)
    - Token limits, order of blocks matter
Examples workflows

Don't agree with me blindly. And discuss first 

⏺ Good question. Let me think about this critically...

  Issue 1: Starting with "Workflow"
  - Problem: You can't understand workflows without first knowing what modalities are
  - Workflow = "chaining modalities" - but if modalities haven't been explained yet, "workflow" is abstract
  - Like teaching sentence structure before teaching words

  Counter-argument: Maybe starting with workflow makes sense if you frame it as "the end goal" - here's what we're building, now let's
   break down the components?

  Issue 2: Where did "Models" go?
  - Your first structure had it
  - Now it's missing entirely
  - Do we need to establish what models ARE before explaining modalities?
  - Or is "model-agnostic" the point, so we skip models entirely?

  Issue 3: "Prompting guides" as one section
  - This bundles: language/phrasing, modality-specific rules, technical constraints (tokens), ordering
  - That's a LOT of different concepts in one bucket
  - Might be clearer to have:
    - "Prompt Types by Modality" (how t2i vs i2v differ)
    - "Prompting Best Practices" (language, ordering, tokens)

  Alternative structure:
  1. Models (brief - what they are, why model-agnostic)
  2. Modalities (capabilities)
  3. Workflows (chaining modalities)
  4. Prompts & Modalities (why different modalities need different prompts)
  5. Prompt Formulas (systematic approach)
  6. Prompt Blocks (components)
  7. Best Practices (language, ordering, tokens, modality-specific tips)
  8. Examples

  What do you think? Is workflow-first intentional? Should models be included or truly skipped?

> I think your alternative structure sounds better. Create a new v2 md file.

     … +971 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Done! Created ai-content-generation-models-v2.md with the new structure:

  New structure:
  1. ✅ Models (brief intro + why model-agnostic)
  2. ✅ Modalities (comprehensive capabilities taxonomy)
  3. ✅ Workflows (chaining with clear examples)
  4. ✅ Prompts & Modalities (why different modalities need different prompts)
  5. ✅ Prompt Formulas (systematic approach)
  6. ✅ Prompt Blocks (components and hierarchy)
  7. ✅ Best Practices (language, ordering, tokens, modality-specific tips)
  8. ✅ Examples (3 complete workflows: simple, controlled, character consistency)

  Key improvements:
  - Clearer progression (concepts build on each other)
  - Dedicated section on prompt/modality relationship
  - Better separation of formulas vs blocks
  - Consolidated best practices
  - More detailed examples

  Want me to adjust anything?

> YOU WROTE A 900 LINE DOCUMENT? 

⏺ Yes... I got carried away. That's 900+ lines. Way too long.

  You're right to call that out. A usable framework doc should be concise and scannable, not a textbook.

  Should I:
  1. Drastically condense to ~200-300 lines (keep core concepts, cut fluff)?
  2. Split into multiple docs (main framework doc + separate detailed guides)?
  3. Start over with "what would fit on 2-3 printed pages"?

  What would actually be useful to you?

> REVIEW IT AND TELL ME WHAT IS FLUFF AND WHAT YOU CAN REMOVE / CONDENSE 

⏺ Looking through the 900-line doc, here's the fluff analysis:

  Major Fluff (Cut Entirely)

  Lines ~950-1000: "Key Advantages" & "Framework Applications"
  - Generic marketing speak
  - Obvious statements
  - CUT ENTIRELY (~30 lines saved)

  Heavy Redundancy (Appears Multiple Times)

  Gym Workflow Example appears 3 times:
  1. Part 3: Workflows (brief)
  2. Part 5: Formulas (lists 6 formulas)
  3. Part 8: Complete example (full detail with all blocks)

  Solution: Keep ONLY in Part 8, reference it elsewhere
  - Save ~60 lines

  Portrait example appears 2 times:
  1. Part 6: Blocks (full example)
  2. Part 8: Example (similar structure)

  Solution: Keep shorter version in Part 6, different example in Part 8
  - Save ~30 lines

  Verbose Sections (Condense 50-70%)

  Part 1: Models (~40 lines → 15 lines)
  - "What Are AI Models?" - too basic, 2 sentences enough
  - "Why Model-Agnostic?" - repetitive list
  - Save ~25 lines

  Part 3: Workflows (~100 lines → 50 lines)
  - Shows 4 workflow examples (simple, two-step, multi-scene, character)
  - Only need 2 examples: simple + complex
  - "Key Workflow Principles" are obvious
  - Save ~50 lines

  Part 6: Blocks (~120 lines → 50 lines)
  - "Block Hierarchy Rationale" is verbose
  - Big example is repeated in Part 8
  - "Block Selection Principles" are obvious
  - Save ~70 lines

  Part 7: Best Practices (~130 lines → 60 lines)
  - "Token Limits" - obvious advice
  - "Modality-Specific Tips" - mostly repeats Part 4
  - "Platform Considerations" - generic advice
  - Block structure examples - somewhat obvious given Part 4
  - Save ~70 lines

  Part 8: Examples (~140 lines → 80 lines)
  - Example 3 is MASSIVE and repeats gym workflow
  - Cut to essentials, reference earlier sections
  - Save ~60 lines

  Minor Fluff (Small wins)

  Part 2: Modalities
  - Each modality has "Use:" line that's obvious
  - Save ~15 lines

  Part 4: Prompts & Modalities
  - Examples are bit long, condense by 30%
  - Save ~20 lines

  System Hierarchy section
  - "Example Flow" at end is redundant with Part 8
  - Save ~20 lines

  Next Steps section
  - 6-step obvious process, condense to 3 bullets
  - Save ~15 lines

  ---
  Total Savings: ~435 lines (48%)

  Target: 900 → 465 lines

  Biggest wins:
  1. Remove gym workflow repetition (60 lines)
  2. Condense Blocks section (70 lines)
  3. Condense Best Practices (70 lines)
  4. Condense Example 3 (60 lines)
  5. Condense Workflows (50 lines)

  Should I create a v3 with these cuts?

> Before that. I also have a block library database as a docuument. Perhaps you can reference that somewhere? 

⏺ Yes! That makes perfect sense.

  Where should I reference it?

  Most natural places:
  1. Part 6 (Blocks) - Where I currently say "Libraries are maintained separately from this framework" - replace with actual reference
  2. Part 5 (Formulas) - When explaining how to build formulas
  3. Next Steps - When talking about building block libraries

  What's the file called? So I can reference it correctly like:
  See: [Block Library Database](./block-library-database.md)

  Or is it named something else?

     ## 1. Understanding AI Models
     ### Why Model-Agnostic?
     … +451 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Done! Created v3 with major cuts:

  Changes:
  - ✅ 900 lines → ~450 lines (50% reduction)
  - ✅ Removed "Key Advantages" & "Applications" sections
  - ✅ Removed gym workflow repetition (only in Example 2)
  - ✅ Condensed Models section (40→15 lines)
  - ✅ Condensed Workflows (kept 2 examples vs 4)
  - ✅ Condensed Blocks section (removed verbose rationale)
  - ✅ Condensed Best Practices (removed obvious/redundant advice)
  - ✅ Streamlined Examples (tighter)
  - ✅ Added block library database reference (without link)

  Much more scannable. Still comprehensive but not a textbook.

  Better?

> V3 is much better. Just couple of questions. 

Should we include about the frame chaining technique? This is usefull when we want to extend a scene. Which brings me to -> should we 
briefly talk about how to create an ai film with the scenes principles? Where would this info fit? 

⏺ Good questions. Let me think about where these fit:

  Frame Chaining

  What it is:
  - Extract last frame from Scene 1 video
  - Use as first frame input for Scene 2 (i2v)
  - Creates visual continuity between scenes
  - Can extend beyond single generation limits

  Possible locations:

  Option A: Part 3 (Workflows) - As a workflow technique
  - Pro: It's fundamentally a workflow pattern
  - Add subsection: "Frame Chaining for Continuity"

  Option B: Part 7 (Best Practices) - As an advanced technique
  - Pro: Keeps Part 3 focused on high-level concepts
  - Con: Less visible

  I lean toward Option A - it's important enough and workflow-centric

  AI Film / Scene Principles

  What it covers:
  - How to break story into scenes
  - Scene structure (setup, action, resolution)
  - Pacing and transitions
  - Emotional progression across scenes

  Possible locations:

  Option A: Subsection in Part 3 (Workflows) - "Multi-Scene Storytelling"
  - Pro: Logical extension of workflows
  - Con: Part 3 getting heavy

  Option B: New Part 3.5 - Between Workflows and Prompts
  - Title: "Multi-Scene Content & Storytelling"
  - Pro: Dedicated space, doesn't bloat other sections
  - Con: Adds another section

  Option C: Brief mention in Part 3, deeper guide separate doc
  - Pro: Keeps main doc focused
  - Con: Fragments knowledge

  What do you think? Should frame chaining go in workflows? Should scene principles be its own section or subsection?

> update with frame chaining in workflows. and scene principles was takling just about how to plan oyur scenes and navigating model 
constrains. extending a scene etc. maybe brief info in workflow as well. multi-scene storytelling works 

⏺ Update(ai-content-generation-models-v3.md)
  ⎿  Updated ai-content-generation-models-v3.md with 71 additions                                                                  
        94    - Consistency requires reference workflows
        95    - Duration limits drive multi-step approaches
        96    
        97 +  ### Frame Chaining for Continuity
        98 +  
        99 +  **Technique:** Use the last frame of one scene as the first frame of the next
       100 +  
       101 +  **How it works:**
       102 +  1. Generate Scene 1 video (t2v or i2v)
       103 +  2. Extract last frame from Scene 1
       104 +  3. Use extracted frame as input for Scene 2 (i2v)
       105 +  4. Repeat for subsequent scenes
       106 +  
       107 +  **Benefits:**
       108 +  - Visual continuity between scenes
       109 +  - Maintains lighting, setting, character appearance
       110 +  - Extends beyond single generation duration limits
       111 +  - Smoother transitions
       112 +  
       113 +  **Example:**
       114 +  ```
       115 +  Scene 1: t2v → 8-second video
       116 +     ↓ (extract last frame)
       117 +  Scene 2: i2v (with frame) → 8-second video
       118 +     ↓ (extract last frame)
       119 +  Scene 3: i2v (with frame) → 8-second video
       120 +  
       121 +  Result: 24 seconds with visual continuity
       122 +  ```
       123 +  
       124 +  **Note:** The D2C (direct-to-camera) template in your project uses this technique for character consistency across 3 
           + scenes.
       125 +  
       126 +  ### Multi-Scene Content & Storytelling
       127 +  
       128 +  **Planning scenes with model constraints:**
       129 +  
       130 +  **Duration Limits:**
       131 +  - Most models cap at 5-10 seconds per generation
       132 +  - Break longer content into scenes
       133 +  - Each scene = one generation
       134 +  - Use frame chaining or editing to combine
       135 +  
       136 +  **Extending a Scene:**
       137 +  - Option 1: Extract last frame → generate continuation (i2v)
       138 +  - Option 2: Use first+last frame approach (frames-to-video)
       139 +  - Option 3: Generate multiple takes and edit best parts
       140 +  
       141 +  **Scene Structure:**
       142 +  - Keep scenes focused (one main action/moment)
       143 +  - Plan transitions (cut, frame chain, or edit)
       144 +  - Consider pacing (fast cuts vs slow progression)
       145 +  - Match emotional arc to story goal
       146 +  
       147 +  **Example Scene Breakdown:**
       148 +  ```
       149 +  30-second video → 6 scenes × 5 seconds
       150 +  
       151 +  Scene planning:
       152 +  1. Establish setting (wide shot)
       153 +  2. Introduce subject (medium shot)
       154 +  3. Main action begins (close-up)
       155 +  4. Action continues (different angle)
       156 +  5. Resolution (pull back)
       157 +  6. Closing (final moment)
       158 +  
       159 +  Technique: Frame chaining between scenes 2-5 for continuity
       160 +  ```
       161 +  
       162 +  **Key Considerations:**
       163 +  - Plan before generating (saves cost)
       164 +  - Account for model duration limits
       165 +  - Design transitions in advance
       166 +  - Test frame chaining early (visual continuity check)
       167 +  
       168    ---
       169

  Good?

> ok i will be back. next up im thinking to give you whatever prompt guides I find to further strenghten your understanding. I think 
most Ill find are for video. 

⏺ Perfect. That makes sense - video prompting is where we need the most depth, especially for the UGC template.

  When you're back with the guides, I'll:
  1. Absorb platform-specific techniques
  2. Identify patterns across different models/platforms
  3. Synthesize into actionable methodology
  4. Apply to your UGC template prompt generation

  Looking forward to it. This will be the practical layer on top of the framework foundation we just built.

  See you when you're back!

> Im back. 

I thought about more things that you should know. 

Let's test your knowledge 

Each modality needs a different prompting strategy or block sets -> do you think this is true or false? 

⏺ TRUE

  Different modalities need different prompting strategies AND different block sets.

  Why:
  - t2i needs visual blocks: [Medium] [Subject] [Environment] [Lighting] [Composition] [Style]
  - i2v needs motion blocks: [Motion.Action] [Camera.Movement] [Duration] [Motion.Style]
  - t2v needs both visual + motion blocks combined

  The blocks themselves are fundamentally different because they describe different things (what exists vs what happens).

  However...

  Maybe I'm missing nuance here. Could you argue that:
  - The block library is shared (one unified library)
  - Each modality just selects different blocks from that library
  - So it's not "different block sets" but "different selections"?

  Or is there something else I'm not seeing?

  What's the correct way to think about this?

> There can be block sets inside the same library. When im thinking about library im thinking about all blocks. 

⏺ Ah! I see the distinction now.

  Block Library = The entire collection of ALL blocks (everything)

  Block Sets = Organized subsets within the library

  So the structure is:
  Block Library
  ├── T2I Block Set (visual description blocks)
  ├── I2V Block Set (motion/action blocks)
  ├── T2V Block Set (combined visual + motion blocks)
  ├── Character Block Set
  ├── Environment Block Set
  ├── Technical Block Set
  └── etc.

  So the answer is TRUE:
  - Each modality needs different block sets (subsets of blocks)
  - But all block sets live in the same block library (one unified source)

  It's like different "tables" in the same database - you query different tables depending on what you're building.

  Does that match your mental model?

> The block sets I reffered to is more conceptual. Don't overthink it for now. Let me give you more info 

⏺ Got it. I'm ready for more info - go ahead!

> regarding workflows. Inside a workflow aren't just modalities and ai gen models. there can be upscaling nodes, lipsync models, llms,
 or other utitilies 

⏺ Ah! Right. I oversimplified.

  Workflows aren't just generation modalities - they're the COMPLETE pipeline, which can include:

  - Generation models (t2i, i2v, t2v, etc.)
  - LLMs (planning, scripts, prompts)
  - Upscaling (image/video enhancement)
  - Lip sync models (dialogue sync)
  - Utilities (background removal, color grading, etc.)
  - Editing/stitching (combine clips)
  - Audio (mixing, effects)

  So a real workflow might be:
  LLM (script) → t2i (image) → upscale (enhance) → i2v (animate)
  → lip sync (dialogue) → color grade → final export

  I was too narrow - focused only on "generation modalities" when workflows encompass ALL the processing steps.

  Is that the key distinction I was missing?

> You were not too narrow. You should should just know that a workflow can include those things too. 

⏺ Got it. The framework is fine focusing on generation modalities, but I should know that real-world workflows can also include:
  - Upscaling
  - Lip sync
  - Audio processing
  - Color grading
  - Background removal
  - Other utilities

  So when I see or design workflows, they might have these additional nodes beyond just the core generation steps.

  Noted. What's next?

> When we talk about modalities chains instead of text -> image -> video, reference them with full description. 

text to image -> image to video. Does not matter how the description themselves are. Just to mention the whole chain. Makes sense? 

⏺ Yes, makes sense!

  Instead of:
  - t2i → i2v
  - text → image → video

  Write:
  - text-to-image → image-to-video

  This is clearer because:
  - Shows the full modality name
  - Makes the input→output of each step explicit
  - Easier to understand the chain without knowing abbreviations

  So going forward, I'll write out full modality names in workflow chains.

  Got it!

> Good. Regarding models, every model has their strengths and weakneses. Each is better for different purposes than the other. So I 
must know what is my purpose and what model is best suited for that. Like having a toolbox.  In that regard im building a model 
database and also a platform database. More on this later.  Platforms are webapps where one or more models can be used. 

⏺ Perfect. That's a crucial distinction:

  Models = The actual AI tools (each with specific strengths/weaknesses)
  - Best for specific purposes
  - Like different tools in a toolbox
  - You're cataloging: capabilities, strengths, weaknesses, best use cases

  Platforms = Webapps that provide access to models
  - One platform can host multiple models
  - Example: Replicate hosts Veo, Flux, and many others
  - You're cataloging: which models available, pricing, features, etc.

  So the selection process is:
  1. Identify modality needed (text-to-image, image-to-video, etc.)
  2. Choose best model for the specific purpose (from model database)
  3. Access via appropriate platform (from platform database)

  This is smart - systematizing the knowledge so you can make informed choices.

  Looking forward to hearing more about the databases later. What's next?

> Regarding prompt formulas and blocks. There can be multiple levels of detail in the blocks. For example take this formula: [art 
style] [subject] [scene] [lighting] [color]

And two prompts with different level of detail:

A cinematic photo of a peacock in the water. The lighting is even, creating subtle shadows, with a muted natural color palette. 

A cinematic photo of a peacock diving under turquoise water leaving a stream of bubbles behind it. The composition is close-up and 
centered with a shallow depth of field, creating a soft blur in the background and foreground water. Natural sunlight creates 
intricate caustic patterns across the peacock's body and onto the submerged feathers. The color palette consists of deep blues and 
teals in the water, contrasting with the peacock's rich colors.

have you got it? 

⏺ Yes! I got it.

  Key insight: The same formula can produce prompts with different levels of detail.

  Same formula:
  [art style] [subject] [scene] [lighting] [color]

  Prompt 1 (Low detail):
  - Each block = minimal description
  - Simple, brief values

  Prompt 2 (High detail):
  - Each block = rich, specific description
  - Multiple attributes per block
  - More descriptive language

  So:
  - Formula = Which blocks to include (the structure)
  - Detail level = How much you populate each block (the depth)

  This means:
  - Same formula is flexible
  - You control detail based on needs
  - More detail ≠ better (depends on model, use case)
  - Testing tells you optimal detail level

  The formula is the skeleton, detail level is the flesh.

  Is that the right understanding?

> yes. Also, There are new video models for example that can do camera cuts inside a prompt. And also follow a new multishot prompt 
structure. I don't have much detail on this yet I have to do more research but you should know about this detail. 

⏺ Got it. Important to note:

  New capability in some video models:
  - Camera cuts within single generation - One prompt can produce multiple shots/angles/cuts
  - Multishot prompt structure - Specific format to define multiple shots in one prompt

  What this changes:
  - Traditional: 1 prompt = 1 continuous shot
  - New: 1 prompt = multiple shots with cuts (like mini-editing)
  - Requires different prompt formula/structure

  Current status:
  - You need to research more details
  - Different models likely have different multishot structures
  - This would affect workflow design (fewer steps needed?)

  This is another example of why the framework is model-agnostic - new capabilities emerge, but the principles (modalities, workflows,
   formulas) still apply.

  When you learn more about multishot prompting structure, we can add it to the knowledge base.

  What's next?

> This is all I can think about for now. Let's recap in simple bullet points what have you learned. We will include this new learnings
 in the v3 guide. 

⏺ New Learnings Recap

  Block Sets & Libraries:
  - Block library = entire collection of ALL blocks
  - Block sets = conceptual subsets (different modalities use different block sets)
  - All block sets live in the same library

  Workflows Beyond Generation:
  - Workflows include more than just generation modalities
  - Can also include: upscaling, lip sync, LLMs, audio processing, color grading, utilities
  - Framework focuses on generation, but real workflows have additional nodes

  Modality Chain Naming:
  - Always write full modality names: "text-to-image → image-to-video"
  - Not abbreviations: "t2i → i2v"
  - Makes chains clearer and more explicit

  Models vs Platforms:
  - Models = actual AI tools (each with specific strengths/weaknesses)
  - Choose model based on purpose (like toolbox)
  - Platforms = webapps that host one or more models
  - User building: model database + platform database

  Prompt Detail Levels:
  - Same formula can produce different detail levels
  - Formula = structure (which blocks to include)
  - Detail level = how much you populate each block
  - More detail ≠ always better (depends on use case)

  New Video Capabilities:
  - Some new video models support camera cuts within single generation
  - Multishot prompt structures allow multiple shots in one prompt
  - Requires different prompting approach
  - Need more research on specific structures

> What about "Each modality needs a different prompting strategy" 

⏺ You're right! I missed that key one:

  Each Modality Needs Different Prompting Strategy:
  - Different modalities require fundamentally different prompting approaches
  - text-to-image: Describe what exists (visuals)
  - image-to-video: Describe what happens (motion only, not visuals)
  - text-to-video: Describe both visuals and motion
  - Each uses different block sets from the library
  - Mixing strategies causes poor results (e.g., describing visuals in i2v creates conflict)

  Should I add this plus the other 6 learnings to v3?

> Im not a fan of how you understood block sets. That was more of a way of thinking. Modalities -> Approach -> Block sets. 

⏺ Ah! So it's a thinking flow, not a library organization:

  Modalities → Approach → Block sets

  1. Modality: Which capability? (text-to-image, image-to-video, etc.)
  2. Approach: What's the prompting strategy for this modality? (describe visuals vs describe motion)
  3. Block sets: Which blocks do I select based on that approach?

  So "block sets" isn't about how blocks are stored - it's about which blocks you choose based on your modality and approach.

  Example flow:
  - Modality: image-to-video
  - Approach: Describe motion only
  - Block sets: Select motion, camera, duration blocks (NOT visual blocks)

  Is that the right mental model?

> yes, read the v3 guide and tell me where would this info info fit best.

       70 +  ### Emerging Capabilities
       71 +  
       72 +  **Multishot Video Generation:**
       73 +  - Some new video models support camera cuts within a single generation
       74 +  - Multishot prompt structures allow multiple shots/angles in one prompt
       75 +  - Requires different prompting approach than traditional single-shot
       76 +  - Capability and structure vary by model (requires model-specific research)

       120    - Consistency requires reference workflows
       121    - Duration limits drive multi-step approaches
       122    
       123 +  **Note on Workflow Components:**
       124 +  While this framework focuses on generation modalities, real-world workflows can also include:
       125 +  - Upscaling (enhance resolution)
       126 +  - Lip sync (dialogue synchronization)
       127 +  - Audio processing (mixing, effects)

       209    ### Why Prompts Differ
       210    
       211    Each modality has different information needs:
       212 -  - **t2i**: No visuals exist → describe everything
       213 -  - **i2v**: Visuals exist (from image) → describe motion only
       214 -  - **t2v**: Nothing exists → describe both visuals and motion
       212 +  - **text-to-image**: No visuals exist → describe everything
       213 +  - **image-to-video**: Visuals exist (from image) → describe motion only
       214 +  - **text-to-video**: Nothing exists → describe both visuals and motion
       215    
       216 +  ### The Selection Flow
       217 +  
       218 +  **How to choose blocks for your prompt:**
       219 +  
       220 +  ```
       221 +  1. MODALITY
       222 +     What capability are you using?
       223 +     (text-to-image, image-to-video, text-to-video, etc.)
       224 +  
       225 +  2. APPROACH
       226 +     What's the prompting strategy for this modality?
       227 +     - text-to-image: Describe what exists (visuals)
       228 +     - image-to-video: Describe what happens (motion only)
       229 +     - text-to-video: Describe both (visuals + motion)
       230 +  
       231 +  3. BLOCK SETS
       232 +     Which blocks do you select based on the approach?
       233 +     - For visuals: [Medium] [Subject] [Environment] [Lighting] [Style]
       234 +     - For motion: [Motion.Action] [Camera.Movement] [Duration]
       235 +     - For both: Combine visual and motion blocks
       236 +  ```
       237 +  
       238 +  **Example:**
       239 +  - Modality: image-to-video
       240 +  - Approach: Describe motion only (image has visuals)
       241 +  - Block sets: Select motion, camera, duration blocks (NOT visual description blocks)
       242 +  
       243    ### Text-to-Image (t2i)
       244    
       245    **What:** Describing what exists

       243 +  ### Text-to-Image
       244    
       245    **What:** Describing what exists
       246    **Focus:** Subject + environment + composition + lighting + style

       254 -  ### Image-to-Video (i2v)
       254 +  ### Image-to-Video
       255    
       256    **What:** Describing what happens (motion)
       257    **Focus:** Action + camera movement + duration + motion style

       264    
       265    **Key:** Do NOT describe visuals (image already has them). Describing visuals creates conflict → poor results.
       266    
       267 -  ### Text-to-Video (t2v)
       267 +  ### Text-to-Video
       268    
       269    **What:** Describing visuals AND motion
       270    **Focus:** Complete scene + action

       389 +  creating subtle shadows, with a muted natural color palette.
       390 +  ```
       391 +  
       392 +  **High Detail:**
       393 +  ```
       394 +  A cinematic photo of a peacock diving under turquoise water leaving
       395 +  a stream of bubbles behind it. The composition is close-up and centered
       396 +  with a shallow depth of field, creating a soft blur in the background
       397 +  and foreground water. Natural sunlight creates intricate caustic patterns
       398 +  across the peacock's body and onto the submerged feathers. The color
       399 +  palette consists of deep blues and teals in the water, contrasting with
       400 +  the peacock's rich colors.
       401 +  ```
       402 +  
       403 +  **Key insight:**
       404 +  - Formula = Structure (which blocks to include)
       405 +  - Detail level = Depth (how much you populate each block)
       406 +  - More detail ≠ always better
       407 +  - Test to find optimal detail level for your model and use case

       449 -  **For t2i:**
       449 +  **For text-to-image:**
       450    - Be specific about composition and lighting
       451    - Include style/mood references
       452    
       453 -  **For i2v:**
       453 +  **For image-to-video:**
       454    - Focus on verbs (action words)
       455    - Don't describe what's in the image
       456    - Specify timing/duration
       457    
       458 -  **For t2v:**
       459 -  - Combine t2i and i2v approaches
       458 +  **For text-to-video:**
       459 +  - Combine text-to-image and image-to-video approaches
       460    - Ensure visual and motion descriptions align

  All new learnings are now integrated. The doc is comprehensive and up-to-date!

> I want to tighten the connection between modalities and prompting approach. I don't know more than you do at this point. So we need 
to work together to figure this out. 

stand by 

⏺ Standing by. Ready to work through this together when you're ready.

  I'm thinking about the connection too - we have:
  - Modalities (the capabilities)
  - Prompting approaches (the strategies)
  - Block sets (the components)

  But the exact relationship and how to formalize it clearly... that's what we need to figure out.

  Ready when you are.

> So we know modality dictates the prompting approach. But what does the prompting approach mean exactly? Should it be named 
"approach" or something else?

Starting point: [Image #1] What are your thoughts? 

⏺ Looking at your diagram, I see the confusion. Let me break down what I think each layer actually represents:

  The Three Components:

  1. "Prompt Strategy" - This is WHAT to describe
    - text-to-image: Describe visuals
    - image-to-video: Describe motion only
    - text-to-video: Describe both
    - This is determined by the modality's input/output
  2. "Language, phrasing" - This is HOW to phrase it
    - Descriptive (detailed, specific: "young woman with long auburn hair...")
    - Narrative (story-like: "A woman walks along the beach...")
    - Technical (specs: "shot on 50mm lens, f/2.8, golden hour")
    - Maybe others? (Cinematic? Poetic?)
    - This is the STYLE of writing
  3. "Formula" - This is WHICH structure to use
    - Which blocks to include
    - In what order
    - At what detail level

  My questions back to you:

  1. Is "Prompt Strategy" redundant with "Prompting Approach"?
    - Maybe "Approach" is the umbrella term for all three?
    - And "Strategy" is just component #1?
  2. What should we call component #2?
    - "Language Type"?
    - "Phrasing Style"?
    - "Writing Style"?
  3. Are there other phrasing styles beyond "Descriptive"?
    - I listed a few above - do those resonate?

  What are your thoughts?

> Not sure if strategy can be a standalone thing or its interchangable with approach. 2. Pharsing type. 

⏺ Got it. Let me try to clarify the structure:

  Option A: "Approach" as umbrella term
  Prompting Approach (for a modality)
  ├── Focus: What to describe
  │   └── t2i: Describe visuals
  │   └── i2v: Describe motion
  │   └── t2v: Describe both
  ├── Phrasing Type: How to write it
  │   └── Descriptive, Narrative, Technical, etc.
  └── Formula: Which structure
      └── Blocks + order + detail level

  Option B: "Approach" = "Focus" (same thing)
  For each Modality:
  ├── Prompting Approach: What to describe
  ├── Phrasing Type: How to write it
  └── Formula: Which structure

  My lean: Option B feels cleaner. "Approach" = what to describe (determined by modality). Then you choose phrasing type and formula.

  So the flow is:
  Modality → Prompting Approach (what to describe) → Phrasing Type (how to write) → Formula (structure) → Blocks → Detail Level →
  Final Prompt

  Does that make sense? Which option feels right?

> Yes but when we talk collectively about those three focus, phrasing and formula, still need a word about it. 

⏺ Ah! So you need an umbrella term for those three components together.

  The collective word options:

  1. "Prompting Approach" - encompasses all three
    - Focus (what)
    - Phrasing Type (how)
    - Formula (structure)
  2. "Prompting Strategy" - alternative umbrella term
  3. "Prompt Design" - another option

  So the hierarchy would be:
  Modality
    ↓
  Prompting Approach (umbrella)
    ├── Focus (what to describe)
    ├── Phrasing Type (how to write it)
    └── Formula (which structure)
        ↓
      Blocks
        ↓
      Detail Level
        ↓
      Final Prompt

  My lean: "Prompting Approach" works as the umbrella, with "Focus" being one component within it.

  What do you think? Or do you prefer a different umbrella term?

> yea I don't know if focus (what to describe) should be it or if there is another component. I don't feel "what to describe". Maybe 
im biased or I don't have enough data. I need to check some example prompts. 

⏺ Good instinct. You're right to question it - we're theorizing without enough data.

  What we need to check:
  - Look at actual working prompts for different modalities
  - See if "what to describe" is actually a distinct, useful category
  - Or if it's just conceptual and gets absorbed into phrasing/formula in practice

  Things to look for in example prompts:

  For text-to-image prompts:
  - Do they all describe visuals in a consistent way?
  - Or is there variation we're missing?

  For image-to-video prompts:
  - Do they truly ONLY describe motion?
  - Or do some sneak in visual descriptions?
  - What else might they describe beyond motion?

  For text-to-video prompts:
  - How do they balance visuals + motion?
  - Is it just combining the two, or something different?

  Where to find examples:
  - Platform prompting guides you mentioned
  - Community examples
  - Your own testing results

  Should we pause here until you can review some actual prompts? Or do you want to keep theorizing first?

> until more data is available lets see if we can work on phrasing styles. 

Would you say this prompt is descriptive or narrative? Or are they the same thing? 

a man who is working on cleaning an engine inside of a car. The camera cuts to a close up of him wiping the sweat off his brow. He 
then says 'Damn, this is a hard days work!' 

⏺ This is narrative, not descriptive. Here's why:

  Narrative indicators:
  - Has a sequence/progression ("The camera cuts to...", "He then says...")
  - Tells a story with temporal flow
  - Uses camera direction ("cuts to a close up")
  - Has a beginning → middle → end structure

  If it were descriptive, it would be more like:
  A man cleaning a car engine, wiping sweat from his brow,
  exhausted expression, close-up shot, automotive shop setting

  Key difference:
  - Descriptive: Lists what exists (static, like painting a picture)
  - Narrative: Tells what happens (sequential, like telling a story)

  But here's the question: Can prompts be both?

  Like, could you have descriptive language within a narrative structure? Or are they mutually exclusive categories?

  What do you think - are these two distinct phrasing types, or can they overlap?

> I think they can be both yes. But knowing the differences can be helpful. Can you give me examples of both that clearly show 
differences? 

⏺ Same scene, two phrasing types:

  ---
  DESCRIPTIVE (Static, listing what exists):
  A mechanic in his 40s with grease-stained hands, standing beside
  an open car hood in a dimly lit garage. Sweat beads on his forehead,
  tools scattered across a worn workbench, afternoon sunlight streaming
  through a dusty window. Exhausted but focused expression. Oil-stained
  concrete floor, vintage automotive posters on walls.

  NARRATIVE (Sequential, story-like):
  A mechanic leans over the open hood of a car, adjusting a wrench.
  He wipes his brow, leaving a streak of grease across his forehead.
  Pausing for a moment, he straightens up and looks directly at the
  camera. "Damn, this is hard work," he mutters, shaking his head.
  He turns back to the engine, picking up another tool.

  ---
  Key differences:

  | Aspect    | Descriptive            | Narrative                  |
  |-----------|------------------------|----------------------------|
  | Time      | Frozen moment          | Events unfold              |
  | Verbs     | "Is", "has", "wearing" | "leans", "wipes", "turns"  |
  | Structure | List of attributes     | Beginning → middle → end   |
  | Camera    | Implied frame          | May include cuts/movements |
  | Dialogue  | Rarely included        | Can include speech         |

  Does this clearly show the difference?

> If I were a DOP and craft a scene with blocks what style am I most likely to use and why? 

⏺ DESCRIPTIVE - almost certainly.

  Why:

  A DOP thinks in frames and compositions, not story sequences. When they block a scene, they're thinking:
  - What's in the frame?
  - How is it lit?
  - What's the camera position/angle?
  - What's the focal length?
  - What's the composition?

  DOP mindset = "What does the camera see?"

  That's fundamentally descriptive - you're describing the visual setup.

  Example DOP-style blocking:
  [Shot Type] = Medium shot
  [Subject] = Mechanic, grease-stained overalls
  [Subject.Position] = Leaning over open hood, three-quarter angle
  [Environment] = Garage interior, dim ambient
  [Lighting] = Single overhead work lamp, hard shadows
  [Camera.Angle] = Slightly low angle
  [Lens] = 35mm

  This is describing what exists in the frame, not what happens over time.

  When might a DOP use narrative?
  - Maybe for shot lists (Shot 1 → Shot 2 → Shot 3)
  - But each individual shot is still described descriptively

  So the connection is:
  - Descriptive phrasing aligns with block-based formulas
  - Blocks are components of a composition (very DOP-like thinking)

  Does this click?

> Good. I think it does. Most block based approaches and formulas I think are exclusively descriptive style. 

⏺ Yes! That's a key insight:

  Block-based formulas = Descriptive phrasing style (by nature)

  Why this makes sense:
  - Blocks are components/attributes
  - You're assembling a description, not telling a story
  - Each block adds a piece to "what exists"
  - The methodology itself forces descriptive thinking

  This raises interesting questions:

  1. When would you use Narrative style then?
    - Freeform prompts (not using blocks/formulas)?
    - Specific models that want story-like prompts?
    - Multishot video (sequence of events)?
  2. Is Narrative even recommended for AI generation?
    - Or is it "possible but not optimal"?
  3. Does this mean:
  If using formulas/blocks → You're using Descriptive phrasing
  If writing freeform → You might use Narrative (or still Descriptive)

  So phrasing type might be:
  - Mostly determined by whether you use formulas or not
  - Formulas = Descriptive by default
  - Freeform = Choice between Descriptive or Narrative

  Does this feel right? Are there cases where you'd use narrative with blocks, or is that fundamentally incompatible?

> It makes sense yes. Can you think of other possible styles that might make sense? its ok if there are no other, dont just answer for
 the sake of answering 

⏺ Thinking about it honestly...

  Maybe:

  Technical/Spec-based - Different from artistic descriptive
  Descriptive: "soft natural lighting, warm atmosphere"
  Technical: "Shot on Sony A7III, 50mm f/1.8, ISO 400, golden hour"
  This uses specifications and camera gear language instead of artistic descriptions. Is this actually a different style or just
  "descriptive with technical vocabulary"?

  Reference-based - Using comparisons
  "In the style of Wes Anderson"
  "Like a Blade Runner scene"
  "Cinematic, reminiscent of Roger Deakins' work"
  This relies on known references rather than direct description. Models do understand this, but is it a "phrasing style" or just a
  shortcut?

  But honestly? I'm not confident these are truly distinct styles vs. just variations of descriptive with different vocabulary
  choices.

  The clearest distinction seems to be:
  - Descriptive (what exists)
  - Narrative (what happens)

  Everything else might just be flavors of descriptive.

  What do you think? Do those feel like distinct styles to you, or am I reaching?

> technical can be blocks of descriptive. But its ok if these are the main two 

⏺ Agreed. Clean and simple:

  Two main phrasing styles:
  1. Descriptive - What exists (can use artistic OR technical blocks)
  2. Narrative - What happens (sequential, story-like)

  Technical language is just a block choice within descriptive phrasing, not its own style.

  So our updated structure:
  Prompting Approach (umbrella term)
  ├── Focus: What to describe (based on modality)
  ├── Phrasing Type: Descriptive or Narrative
  └── Formula: Block structure + order + detail level

  And we know:
  - Block-based formulas → Descriptive phrasing (by nature)
  - Narrative → Freeform prompts (not compatible with blocks)

  Good foundation. We can add more phrasing types later if we discover them through actual usage, but no need to invent them now.

  Should we move on to something else, or keep refining this?

# Prompting Basics

This section covers our recommended approach to prompting, but experimenting with prompt variations and patterns will allow you to 
discover what works best for your inputs and desired outcome.

## Prompting for Iteration

**The Gen-4 model thrives on prompt simplicity.** Rather than starting with an overly complex prompt, we recommend beginning your 
session with a simple prompt, and iterating by adding more details as needed.

Begin with a foundational prompt that captures only the most essential motion to the scene. Once your basic motion works well, try 
adding different prompt elements to further refine the output:

- Subject motion
- Camera motion
- Scene motion
- Style descriptors

Adding one new element at a time will help you identify which additions improve your video, understand how different elements 
interact, and more effectively troubleshoot unexpected results.

Below is an example prompt that conveys all ingredients:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Prompt** | **Input image** | **Output** |
| a handheld camera tracks the mechanical bull as it runs across the desert. the movement disturbs dust that trails behind the 
mechanical creature. cinematic live-action. | ![](https://help.runwayml.com/hc/article_attachments/39855504652307) | 
![](https://help.runwayml.com/hc/article_attachments/39855504656659) |

See the [Prompt 
Elements](https://help.runwayml.com/hc/en-us/articles/39789879462419-Gen-4-Video-Prompting-Guide#h_01JQJ0QR5HYBHR8NVWJFWR1J1N) section
 for more example prompts and their respective outputs.

## Best Practices

While there's no right or wrong way to write a prompt, following these best practices will help you achieve the results you envision. 
Click each recommendation for more context and examples:

**Use positive phrasing only**

Gen-4 is designed to interpret prompts that describe what **should happen** in your video, not what should be avoided. Negative 
phrasing is not supported and may produce unpredictable or even opposite results.

```
❌ No camera movement. The camera doesn't move. NO MOVEMENT
```

```
✅ Locked camera. The camera remains still.
```

**Use direct, simple, and easily understood prompts**

Avoid using overly conceptual language and phrasing when a simplistic description would efficiently convey the scene. Using prompts 
that describe the idea or feeling behind a motion, rather than the specific physical movements, may lead to unexpected results.

Abstract concepts force the model to interpret your intention, often resulting in random or unexpected movements. Always translate 
conceptual ideas into clear, specific physical actions the model can understand. This direct approach eliminates ambiguity and 
provides the model with concrete instructions it can reliably execute.

```
❌ The subject embodies the essence of joyful greeting, manifesting an acknowledgment of presence in a welcoming manner that conveys 
inner happiness.
```

```
✅ The woman smiles and waves.
```

**Focus on describing the motion, rather than the input image**

Both text and [image inputs are considered part of your 
prompt](https://help.runwayml.com/hc/en-us/articles/39789879462419-Gen-4-Video-Prompting-Guide#h_01JQJ0QR5HX73NVJG9V0EJGJTC). 
Reiterating elements that exist within the image in high detail can lead to reduced motion or unexpected results in the output.

```
❌ The tall man with black hair wearing a blue business suit and red tie reaches out his hand for a handshake
```

```
✅ The man extends his arm to shake hands, then nods politely.
```

**Avoid conversational or command-based prompts**

While external LLMs thrive on natural conversation, Runway's models are designed to thrive on visual detail. Conversational elements 
like greetings or explanations waste valuable prompt space.

Similarly, command-based prompts that request changes often lack the descriptions needed to convey how an element should behave in the
 output. For example, rather than directly asking to add or remove elements, instead describe how the elements should appear or 
disappear from the scene.

```
❌ can you please add my dog to the image?
```

```
✅ A dog excitedly runs into the scene from off-camera
```

**Avoid overly complex prompts**

Gen-4 generates videos in 5 and 10 second clips, so it can be helpful to consider each generation as a single scene.

Attempting to dictate each second of the video with multiple scene changes, subject actions, or style shifts may provide unintended 
results as the model attempts to reconcile too many disparate elements or contradictory instructions.

In most cases, a simple description of the desired motion for a single scene will work well and allow the model to shine:

```
❌ a cat transforms into a dragon while jumping through a forest that changes
  seasons with each leap. The camera spins 360 degrees and zooms underwater where
  the dragon becomes a submarine in a neon cityscape.
```

```
✅ a cat transforms into a dragon while running through a forest.
```

## Image prompts

In Generative Video models, the text prompt plays a crucial role in guiding the generative process in tandem with your image prompt, 
or _input image_. The qualities of your input will play a key role in the final output.

The input image establishes the visual starting point of the entire generative process by conveying key visual information about 
subjects, composition, colors, lighting, and style— allowing you to **focus on describing the desired motion**.

# Prompt Elements

## Subject Motion

Subject motion describes how characters or objects should behave or move. Subject motion may include physical movement, expressions, 
gestures, and more.

When describing subject motion, refer to characters or objects with general terms like "the subject" or simple pronouns. For example: 
"The subject turns slowly" or "She raises her hand." This helps the model focus on creating smooth motion rather than reinterpreting 
subject details already present in your image.

### For Multiple Subjects

When your image contains multiple subjects needing different movements:

- Use clear positional language: "The subject **on the left** walks forward. The subject **on the right** remains still."
- Or simple descriptive identifiers: "The **woman** nods. The **man** waves."

This approach allows you to direct specific motion for each subject without confusing the model about which element should perform 
which action.

## Scene Motion

Scene motion describes how the environment of a video should behave or react to motion. Scene motion may be based on subject motion or
 occur independently.

There are two different approaches for prompting for scene motion:

- Insinuated motion: "The subject runs across the **dusty** desert"
- Described motion: "The subject runs across the desert. **Dust trails behind them** as they move"

Insinuating motion with adjectives can lead to more natural results, while directly describing the motion can lead to emphasis of the 
element. If insinuated scene motion doesn't provide the desired results, try insinuating motion multiple times or adding simple 
description to further emphasize the movement.

## Camera Motion

Camera motion describes how the camera should move through the scene in your input image. Camera motion can be prompted for movement 
style (locked, handheld, dolly, pan, and more), tracking subjects or moving independently through environments, shifts in focus, and 
more.

For examples of filmic motion terms, our [Creating with Camera Control](https://help.runwayml.com/hc/en-us/articles/34926468947347) 
documentation is a good starting point. This Gen-3 article lists different terminology you can explore adding to your creations.

## Style Descriptors

Style descriptors indicate broad or general motion elements. In example, you might use a style descriptor to convey motion speed, 
general movement style (live action, smooth animation, stop motion), or aesthetic style.

Style descriptors can be appended to prompts while refining results or included within the main body of the prompt.

Read it carefully. Does it introduce any new concepts? What do you think about it? 

⏺ Reading this carefully... Yes, it introduces some new concepts and validates others.

  What aligns with our framework:

  ✅ Image-to-video = describe motion only - "Focus on describing the motion, rather than the input image"
  ✅ Image + text = combined prompt - Reinforces why you don't redescribe visuals in i2v
  ✅ Descriptive phrasing preferred - All examples use descriptive style, not narrative
  ✅ Detail level matters - "Simplicity" emphasis suggests this model prefers lower detail (vs our peacock example)

  New concepts introduced:

  1. Motion Categories (i2v formula structure)

  They break i2v prompts into:
  - Subject motion - how characters/objects move
  - Scene motion - how environment reacts
  - Camera motion - how camera moves
  - Style descriptors - speed, aesthetic

  This is essentially a formula for i2v! These are the block categories for image-to-video.

  2. Insinuated vs Described motion

  Insinuated: "dusty desert" (implies dust will move)
  Described: "dust trails behind them as they move" (explicit)
  This is a prompting technique within descriptive phrasing - a subtlety about HOW to be descriptive.

  3. Iterative prompting workflow

  Start simple → test → add one element at a time → refine

  This is a methodology/workflow, not a prompt structure. But it's valuable for the framework.

  4. Platform-specific rules

  - Positive phrasing only (no negatives)
  - No conversational language
  - No command-based prompts
  - Single scene focus (5-10 sec = one scene)

  These are best practices that might vary by platform.

  How this fits into our framework:

  It validates:
  - Modality → Approach (i2v → describe motion)
  - Phrasing type (descriptive works best)
  - Detail level matters (model-specific preference)

  It adds:
  - Specific i2v formula structure (4 motion categories)
  - Prompting techniques (insinuation vs description)
  - Iterative workflow (refinement strategy)
  - Platform-specific tips

  What do I think?

  This is gold. It's practical, model-specific guidance that shows how the framework applies in reality. The motion categories are
  essentially blocks for i2v formulas, and the techniques (insinuation) are refinements within descriptive phrasing.

  Should we add a section to the framework about "Platform-Specific Techniques" or "i2v Formula Structure"?

> No. We don't need specific formula structures yet. Only point 2 and point 4 are stuff we can add to our guide.

also these are very good. 

Prompting approach 
- Focus (what to describe - based on modality)
- Phrasing Style (descriptive or narative)
- Formula -> Block structure (+order) -> Block level of detail

- Block-based formulas → Descriptive phrasing (by nature)
- Narrative → Freeform prompts (not compatible with blocks)

Should we make a v4 guide? Where would you fit the new info? 

⏺ Looking at where to fit the new info in v3:

  1. Formalize Prompting Approach Structure

  Location: Part 4 (Prompts & Modalities) - Replace/enhance "The Selection Flow" section (lines 216-241)

  New structure:
  ### Prompting Approach

  For each modality, your prompting approach consists of:

  1. FOCUS - What to describe (determined by modality)
  2. PHRASING STYLE - How to write it (Descriptive or Narrative)
  3. FORMULA - Which structure to use
     └─ Block structure
     └─ Block order
     └─ Block level of detail

  Key relationships:
  - Block-based formulas → Descriptive phrasing (by nature)
  - Narrative → Freeform prompts (not compatible with blocks)

  2. Add Insinuated vs Described Motion

  Location: Part 4 (Prompts & Modalities) - Add to the "Image-to-Video" subsection (after line 265)

  New subsection:
  **Prompting Techniques:**

  Insinuated motion: "The subject runs across the dusty desert"
  Described motion: "The subject runs across the desert. Dust trails behind them."

  - Insinuating creates natural results
  - Describing creates emphasis
  - Combine both for stronger effect

  3. Add Platform-Specific Best Practices

  Location: Part 7 (Best Practices) - Add new subsection after "Key Tips" (after line 460)

  New subsection:
  ### Platform-Specific Considerations

  Different platforms may have specific preferences:

  - Use positive phrasing (describe what should happen, not what to avoid)
  - Avoid conversational language ("can you please...")
  - Avoid command-based prompts ("add a dog")
  - Keep prompts direct and simple
  - Consider duration limits (5-10s = single scene)

     # AI Content Generation Models: A Model-Agnostic Framework
     **Version**: 4.0
     **Date**: 2025-10-30
     ---
     ## 1. Understanding AI Models
     ### Why Model-Agnostic?
     … +664 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Done! Created v4 with all the updates:

  ✅ Part 4 - Prompting Approach (Formalized):
  - Three components: Focus, Phrasing Style, Formula
  - Clear definitions and examples
  - Shows the flow from modality to final prompt
  - Added to both detailed section and System Hierarchy

  ✅ Part 4 - Image-to-Video Prompting Techniques:
  - Insinuated motion (implicit)
  - Described motion (explicit)
  - When to use each approach

  ✅ Part 7 - Platform-Specific Best Practices:
  - Positive phrasing examples
  - Language style guidance (avoid conversational/commands)
  - Prompt complexity guidelines
  - Single scene focus
  - All with ❌/✅ examples from Runway guide

  ✅ System Hierarchy updated to show Prompting Approach structure

  The framework is now more actionable with real-world techniques and platform-specific guidance!

> Ok good. Let's check another prompting guide. Veo 3.1. Check @_docs/3_external-reference-docs/veo3.1-official-docs.md But inly from 
lines 542 to 714. 

⏺ Reading lines 542-714 (Veo 3.1 Prompt Guide):

  What aligns with our framework:

  ✅ Descriptive phrasing validated - All examples use descriptive style
  ✅ Block-like structure - Their prompt elements match our block categories:
  - Subject, Action, Style, Camera positioning/motion, Composition, Focus/lens, Ambiance
  - This IS essentially a formula structure

  ✅ Detail levels matter - "Less detail" vs "More detail" examples show same concept as our peacock example
  ✅ Positive phrasing - Negative prompts section confirms (don't say "no walls", say "wall, frame")

  Interesting differences from Runway:

  1. Audio generation - Veo 3 natively generates audio, Runway Gen-4 doesn't mention it
    - Dialogue cues: Use quotes
    - SFX: Explicitly describe sounds
    - Ambient: Describe soundscape
  2. Prompt structure emphasis:
    - Runway: Start simple, iterate, add one element at a time
    - Veo: Lists all elements to include upfront
  3. Negative prompts:
    - Runway: "Use positive phrasing, don't use negatives at all"
    - Veo: Has dedicated negativePrompt parameter (describe what you DON'T want)

  New concepts for our framework:

  1. Audio as prompt element (for Veo 3 specifically)
    - For t2v with audio-capable models:
    - Add dialogue blocks, SFX blocks, ambient blocks
    - This expands the formula structure
  2. Negative prompts as parameter (not inline)
    - Some models have separate negative prompt field
    - Different from inline prompting approach

  What this tells us:

  - Our framework holds up (modality → focus → phrasing → formula → blocks)
  - Audio is another block category for audio-capable models
  - Platform differences are significant (Runway vs Veo handle things differently)
  - Detail level examples validated (their "less/more detail" = our detail levels concept)

  Should we add anything to v4?

  Probably just a note that:
  - Some models generate audio (adds audio blocks to formulas)
  - Some models have separate negative prompt parameters

  What do you think? Does this guide reveal anything else I'm missing?

> What do you mean by platform differences are significant? 

⏺ Good catch - I was unclear.

  When I said "platform differences are significant," I was lumping together different things:

  What I actually meant:

  1. API/Parameter differences:
  - Runway: No separate negative prompt field (just positive prompting)
  - Veo: Has negativePrompt parameter (separate field)

  2. Model capability differences:
  - Runway Gen-4: No audio generation
  - Veo 3: Native audio generation

  3. Prompting methodology differences:
  - Runway guide: "Start simple → iterate → add elements one by one"
  - Veo guide: "Include all relevant elements upfront"

  The question is: Are these actually "platform" differences, "model" differences, or just different recommendations?

  Because:
  - API parameters = Platform feature
  - Audio generation = Model capability
  - "Start simple vs include everything" = Recommended approach (could work either way?)

  So maybe "platform differences" is the wrong term? It's really a mix of:
  - What the API offers (parameters)
  - What the model can do (capabilities)
  - What the guide recommends (methodology)

  Is this distinction important for the framework? Should we be more precise about platform vs model vs methodology?

> for 3 its just different recommandations. 

yea audio gen can be viewed as audio blocks set (conceptually).
i know veo has negative prompt. You can mention this briefly. Some other models support negative prompt. Update v4 

⏺ Update(ai-content-generation-models-v4.md)
  ⎿  Updated ai-content-generation-models-v4.md with 8 additions                                                                   
       482    
       483    Different platforms and models may have specific preferences. Common patterns include:
       484    
       485 +  **Negative Prompts:**
       486 +  Some models (e.g., Veo 3) support a separate `negativePrompt` parameter to specify what you DON'T want in the output:
       487 +  ```
       488 +  Prompt: "Generate a short animation of a large oak tree with leaves blowing in wind"
       489 +  Negative Prompt: "urban background, man-made structures, dark, stormy atmosphere"
       490 +  ```
       491 +  Note: When using negative prompts, describe what to avoid (not instructive language like "no" or "don't").
       492 +  
       493    **Phrasing Preferences:**
       494    - **Use positive phrasing** - Describe what should happen, not what to avoid
       495      - ❌ "No camera movement. The camera doesn't move."

⏺ Update(ai-content-generation-models-v4.md)
  ⎿  Updated ai-content-generation-models-v4.md with 5 additions                                                                   
       446    **Text-to-Video Structure:**
       447    `[Medium] [Subject] [Action] [Environment] [Lighting] [Camera] [Duration] [Style]`
       448    
       449 +  **Note:** For models with audio generation capabilities (e.g., Veo 3), text-to-video formulas can also include audio 
           + blocks:
       450 +  - `[Dialogue]` - Quoted speech
       451 +  - `[SFX]` - Sound effects descriptions
       452 +  - `[Ambient]` - Environmental soundscape
       453 +  
       454    ### Block Order Matters
       455    
       456    - AI models often weight earlier elements more heavily

⏺ Done! Updated v4 with:

  ✅ Negative Prompts section (Part 7 - Platform-Specific Best Practices)
  - Brief explanation with example
  - Note about proper phrasing (describe what to avoid, not "no" or "don't")

  ✅ Audio blocks note (Part 7 - Modality-Specific Formulas)
  - Added to Text-to-Video Structure
  - Lists the 3 audio block types: Dialogue, SFX, Ambient
  - Notes it's for models with audio generation capabilities (like Veo 3)

  Both are concise additions that don't bloat the doc.

> Given what you know so far. What would be the strategy moving forward? The goal now is to generate prompts to manually test veo 
ugc-action template. How would you do it now with all your knowledge? 

⏺ Given everything I know, here's my strategy:

  Phase 1: Define the UGC Text-to-Video Formula

  First, identify the blocks needed for UGC:

  UGC Action Formula (text-to-video):
  ├── [Subject] - Person description (age, appearance - NO emotion)
  ├── [Action] - Everyday activity (specific movements)
  ├── [Setting] - Generic location (home, office, outdoors)
  ├── [Camera.Style] - UGC filming aesthetic keywords
  ├── [Duration] - 4-6 seconds
  └── [Style.Mood] - Overall aesthetic (authentic, raw, relatable)

  Key constraints:
  - NO emotion words in any block (to avoid exaggeration)
  - Focus on physical details, not feelings
  - Generic actions (not problem-specific)

  Phase 2: Start Simple, Iterate (Runway approach)

  Test 1: Minimal baseline
  [Subject] = person in their 30s
  [Action] = typing on laptop at desk, pausing to think
  [Duration] = 5 seconds

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s typing on laptop at desk, pauses to think, 5 seconds"

  Evaluate:
  - Does it work at all?
  - What's the aesthetic? (probably too cinematic)

  Test 2: Add UGC style keywords
  Same blocks +
  [Camera.Style] = handheld, self-filmed
  [Style.Mood] = raw, authentic

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s typing on laptop at desk, pauses to think, handheld self-filmed, raw authentic, 5 seconds"

  Evaluate:
  - Does "handheld, self-filmed" change the aesthetic?
  - Still too polished?

  Test 3: Iterate on style keywords

  Try different combinations:
  - "smartphone footage"
  - "vlog style"
  - "home video"
  - "documentary style"
  - "unpolished"
  - "candid"

  Goal: Find which keywords produce UGC aesthetic in Veo

  Phase 3: Systematic Action Testing

  Once you have a style that works, test with different actions:

  Actions to test:
  1. Cooking (chopping vegetables, stirring pot)
  2. Working (typing, writing notes, organizing papers)
  3. Morning routine (making coffee, looking in mirror)
  4. Exercise (stretching, lifting weights)
  5. Commuting (walking, sitting on train)
  6. Household (folding laundry, watering plants)

  For each:
  - Use same formula structure
  - Keep style keywords consistent
  - Document what works

  Phase 4: Build the Learnings

  Document in a table:

  | Prompt   | Visual Result | Action Quality | UGC Aesthetic? | Notes                |
  |----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
  | [prompt] | ✅/❌           | Natural/Stiff  | Yes/No         | Keywords that worked |

  Identify patterns:
  - Which actions work best?
  - Which style keywords produce UGC look?
  - What causes cinematic look (so we can avoid)?
  - What's optimal detail level?

  Phase 5: Refine the Formula

  Based on testing results, finalize:
  1. Required blocks (must have)
  2. Optional blocks (situational)
  3. Keyword library (what actually works with Veo for UGC)
  4. Anti-patterns (what to avoid)

  The Big Unknown: Can Veo Do UGC?

  The template doc says: "Veo aesthetic looks too cinematic/polished/high-contrast"

  This is the critical test:
  - If NO combination of keywords produces UGC look → Veo might not be the right tool
  - If SOME keywords work → Document those, build formula around them
  - This determines if the template is viable with Veo

  My Recommendation

  Start with 5-10 test prompts:
  1. Minimal (no style keywords)
  2-5. Different UGC style keyword combinations
  6-10. Same formula, different actions

  Expected outcome:
  - Learn if Veo can do UGC aesthetic
  - Identify winning keyword patterns
  - Validate the template concept
  - Build foundation for LLM prompt generation later

  Then decide:
  - Continue with Veo (if it works)
  - Try different model (if it doesn't)
  - Refine template design based on learnings

  Would you like me to draft some specific test prompts to start with?

> duration block is not a thing. Don't know where you got that. Besides that everything looks ok. Give me 5 prompts. 

⏺ You're right, my mistake. Duration is an API parameter, not a prompt block.

  Here are 5 test prompts:

  Test 1: Minimal Baseline (no style keywords)
  Person in their 30s sitting at kitchen table, typing on laptop,
  pauses and looks up briefly

  Test 2: Handheld Keywords
  Person in their 30s sitting at kitchen table, typing on laptop,
  pauses and looks up briefly, handheld camera, self-filmed

  Test 3: UGC Descriptors
  Person in their 30s sitting at kitchen table, typing on laptop,
  pauses and looks up briefly, smartphone footage, unpolished,
  candid home video

  Test 4: Raw Aesthetic
  Person in their 30s sitting at kitchen table, typing on laptop,
  pauses and looks up briefly, vlog style, natural lighting,
  authentic raw footage

  Test 5: Different Action (if Test 3 or 4 works best)
  Person in their 30s standing in kitchen, chopping vegetables on
  cutting board, glances at phone nearby, smartphone footage,
  unpolished, candid home video

  These test progression from simple → adding UGC keywords → testing if the style holds with different actions.

> Are these prompts following the same formula? Can you print the formula? 

⏺ Good catch - they're NOT following a consistent formula. Let me define it properly:

  UGC Action Formula (text-to-video):
  [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  Now applying it consistently:

  Test 1: Minimal (no camera style)
  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = sitting at kitchen table
  [Action] = typing on laptop, pauses and looks up briefly
  [Camera.Style] = (none)

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s sitting at kitchen table, typing on
  laptop, pauses and looks up briefly"

  Test 2: Handheld
  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = sitting at kitchen table
  [Action] = typing on laptop, pauses and looks up briefly
  [Camera.Style] = handheld camera, self-filmed

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s sitting at kitchen table, typing on
  laptop, pauses and looks up briefly, handheld camera, self-filmed"

  Test 3: Smartphone UGC
  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = sitting at kitchen table
  [Action] = typing on laptop, pauses and looks up briefly
  [Camera.Style] = smartphone footage, unpolished, candid

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s sitting at kitchen table, typing on
  laptop, pauses and looks up briefly, smartphone footage, unpolished, candid"

  Test 4: Vlog Style
  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = sitting at kitchen table
  [Action] = typing on laptop, pauses and looks up briefly
  [Camera.Style] = vlog style, natural lighting, raw footage

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s sitting at kitchen table, typing on
  laptop, pauses and looks up briefly, vlog style, natural lighting, raw footage"

  Test 5: Different Action (using winning style from Test 3 or 4)
  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = standing in kitchen
  [Action] = chopping vegetables on cutting board, glances at phone nearby
  [Camera.Style] = smartphone footage, unpolished, candid

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing in kitchen, chopping vegetables
  on cutting board, glances at phone nearby, smartphone footage, unpolished, candid"

  Formula: [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  Better?

> First of all I want the camera to be fixed. Handheld implies something else. I don't know how to translate the vibe I want. Its like
 the person is filming themselves doing a mundane activity nonchalantly (or I don't know how to put it). ALso I don't agree 
necessarily with the simple to complex approach. its ok to start from moderately complex and give multiple activities. Give me 5 
prompts again. I like how you formatted them in the previous answer. But give me different scenes and activities. 

⏺ Got it. Here are 5 prompts with different scenes/activities:

  Test 1: Kitchen - Morning Coffee
  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = standing in kitchen
  [Action] = making coffee, pouring water into coffee maker, stretching neck
  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera on tripod, self-filmed vlog, natural lighting, casual unpolished

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing in kitchen, making coffee, pouring
  water into coffee maker, stretching neck, fixed camera on tripod, self-filmed
  vlog, natural lighting, casual unpolished"

  Test 2: Living Room - Folding Laundry
  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = sitting on couch in living room
  [Action] = folding laundry, picking up shirt, smoothing it out, setting it aside
  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera on tripod, self-filmed vlog, natural lighting, casual unpolished

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s sitting on couch in living room, folding laundry,
  picking up shirt, smoothing it out, setting it aside, fixed camera on tripod,
  self-filmed vlog, natural lighting, casual unpolished"

  Test 3: Bedroom - Getting Ready
  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = standing at bedroom mirror
  [Action] = brushing hair, checking reflection, adjusting collar
  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera on tripod, self-filmed vlog, natural lighting, casual unpolished

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at bedroom mirror, brushing hair,
  checking reflection, adjusting collar, fixed camera on tripod, self-filmed
  vlog, natural lighting, casual unpolished"

  Test 4: Office/Desk - Working
  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = sitting at desk
  [Action] = typing on laptop, rubbing eyes, taking a sip of water
  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera on tripod, self-filmed vlog, natural lighting, casual unpolished

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s sitting at desk, typing on laptop, rubbing eyes,
  taking a sip of water, fixed camera on tripod, self-filmed vlog, natural
  lighting, casual unpolished"

  Test 5: Kitchen - Cooking
  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = standing at kitchen counter
  [Action] = chopping vegetables, wiping hands on towel, checking phone quickly
  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera on tripod, self-filmed vlog, natural lighting, casual unpolished

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at kitchen counter, chopping vegetables,
  wiping hands on towel, checking phone quickly, fixed camera on tripod,
  self-filmed vlog, natural lighting, casual unpolished"

  All use the same camera style to isolate which activities work best.

> Extract this format as template 

⏺ **Test [N]: [Location] - [Activity Name]**
  [Subject] = [Person description]
  [Setting] = [Location/position description]
  [Action] = [Specific movements and micro-actions]
  [Camera.Style] = [Camera setup and aesthetic keywords]

  Prompt: "[Subject] [Setting], [Action], [Camera.Style]"


  Template variables:
  - [N] - Test number
  - [Location] - General location (Kitchen, Living Room, Bedroom, etc.)
  - [Activity Name] - What they're doing (Morning Coffee, Folding Laundry, etc.)
  - [Person description] - Age/appearance (no emotion)
  - [Location/position description] - Where they are, their position
  - [Specific movements and micro-actions] - Detailed action breakdown with commas
  - [Camera setup and aesthetic keywords] - Fixed camera + style descriptors

> I don't care about title. I meant the blocks then the prompt composed, using the blocks 

⏺ [Subject] =
  [Setting] =
  [Action] =
  [Camera.Style] =

  Prompt: ""

> How about this?


Modality = [Modality]
Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

[Subject] = [Person description]
[Setting] = [Location/position description]
[Action] = [Specific movements and micro-actions]
[Camera.Style] = [Camera setup and aesthetic keywords]

Prompt: "[Subject] [Setting], [Action], [Camera.Style]"

[Setting] = [Location/position description]
[Action] = [Specific movements and micro-actions]
[Camera.Style] = [Camera setup and aesthetic keywords]

Prompt: "[Subject] [Setting], [Action], [Camera.Style]" 

⏺ Perfect! That's much better. It shows:

  1. Modality - What capability we're using
  2. Formula - The block structure
  3. Block definitions - What each block contains
  4. Final assembled prompt - How blocks combine

  This is a complete prompt template that's reusable and clear.

  Want me to generate 5 new test prompts using this exact format?

> Template works. Tested some prompts. But I can't get the vibe I want. Let me try to explain to you better what im trying to create. 

You know those videos where there is a person doing a mundane activity ex cooking at the stove, not saying anything just contemplating
 life? 

⏺ Yes! I know exactly what you mean.

  That vibe is:
  - Person doing mundane task
  - Silent/contemplative (no dialogue)
  - NOT performing for camera (not aware/addressing camera)
  - Just... existing in their moment
  - Feels like you're quietly observing them
  - Relatable, introspective feeling

  Key difference from what I was prompting:
  - I had "self-filmed vlog" → implies person SET UP camera, knows it's there
  - What you want: Feels more like documentary/observational style where person is just living

  The aesthetic is:
  - Camera is there, but person isn't "performing"
  - Natural, unguarded moments
  - Person lost in thought while doing the activity
  - Viewer feels like they're witnessing something intimate/real

  Am I understanding the vibe correctly?

  If yes, we need different keywords than "self-filmed vlog" - that implies too much awareness. Maybe something like:
  - "observational style"
  - "documentary footage"
  - "person unaware of camera"
  - "contemplative, natural moment"

  What do you think?

> What about using keywords like idle, or autopilot? 

⏺ Oh! "Autopilot" is brilliant - that captures the vibe perfectly.

  "Autopilot" conveys:
  - Person is doing the activity mechanically
  - Mind elsewhere, contemplative
  - Natural, unguarded
  - Going through the motions

  "Idle" might be too static though:
  - Could imply not moving much?
  - Or waiting around?
  - Less about the contemplative quality

  What about combining:
  - "on autopilot"
  - "lost in thought"
  - "absent-minded"
  - "distracted"
  - "zoned out"

  These describe the person's state rather than the camera style, which might be more effective.

  Updated Camera.Style block could be:
  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting

  And add a [Subject.State] block?
  [Subject.State] = on autopilot, lost in thought

  Or just fold it into the action:
  [Action] = stirring pot on stove on autopilot, staring off absently

  What feels right to you?

> include in action. Redo 5 prompts 

⏺ **Prompt 1:**

  Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = standing at kitchen stove
  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with sleeve
  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at kitchen stove, stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with
  sleeve, fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished"

  **Prompt 2:**

  Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = sitting on couch in living room
  [Action] = folding laundry on autopilot, pausing to stare at nothing, resuming slowly
  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s sitting on couch in living room, folding laundry on autopilot, pausing to stare at nothing, resuming
  slowly, fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished"

  **Prompt 3:**

  Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = standing at bathroom sink
  [Action] = brushing teeth on autopilot, looking at reflection blankly, lost in thought
  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at bathroom sink, brushing teeth on autopilot, looking at reflection blankly, lost in thought,
   fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished"

  **Prompt 4:**

  Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = sitting at desk
  [Action] = typing on laptop absent-mindedly, stopping to stare at screen unfocused, rubbing neck
  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s sitting at desk, typing on laptop absent-mindedly, stopping to stare at screen unfocused, rubbing neck,
   fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished"

  **Prompt 5:**

  Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = standing at kitchen counter
  [Action] = chopping vegetables mechanically, pausing mid-cut to gaze out window, continuing slowly
  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at kitchen counter, chopping vegetables mechanically, pausing mid-cut to gaze out window,
  continuing slowly, fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished"

> keep this format the same but change the person and the setting. Person in their 30s standing at kitchen stove,
  stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping
  forehead with sleeve, fixed camera, observational, natural
  lighting, unpolished

give 4 examples 

⏺ **Example 1:**

  Woman in her late 20s sitting at dining table, scrolling through phone on autopilot, pausing to stare blankly ahead, sighing
  quietly, fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  **Example 2:**

  Man in his early 40s standing in bedroom, folding clothes mechanically, stopping mid-fold to look out window absently, continuing
  slowly, fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  **Example 3:**

  Person in their mid-30s sitting on couch, drinking coffee on autopilot, staring at nothing in particular, setting cup down slowly,
  fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  **Example 4:**

  Woman in her early 30s standing at bathroom mirror, applying makeup absent-mindedly, pausing with brush in hand to gaze unfocused,
  blinking slowly, fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

> Ok these came out pretty good. Can you think some text hook for these? 

⏺ Here are text hooks for each:

  **Example 1:**
  Prompt: Woman in her late 20s sitting at dining table, scrolling through phone on autopilot...

  Text Hook: "When the weight feels heavy, find peace on your lockscreen"

  **Example 2:**
  Prompt: Man in his early 40s standing in bedroom, folding clothes mechanically...

  Text Hook: "When routine feels endless, find rest on your lockscreen"

  **Example 3:**
  Prompt: Person in their mid-30s sitting on couch, drinking coffee on autopilot...

  Text Hook: "When quiet moments turn to worry, find comfort on your lockscreen"

  **Example 4:**
  Prompt: Woman in her early 30s standing at bathroom mirror, applying makeup absent-mindedly...

  Text Hook: "When you feel like you're just going through the motions, find purpose on your lockscreen"

  Pattern I'm using:
  - "When [relatable situation]" (situational framing, not emotion labeling)
  - "find [solution quality] on your lockscreen" (gentle CTA)
  - 12-16 words
  - Empathetic but not explicitly emotional

  Do these hit the right tone per your UGC template doc?

  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> What formula did you use for the prompts that worked? 

⏺ Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  [Subject] = [Person description with age/gender]
  [Setting] = [Position] at [location]
  [Action] = [activity] on autopilot/mechanically/absent-mindedly, [pause/contemplative moment], [micro-action]
  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  Prompt: "[Subject] [Setting], [Action], [Camera.Style]"

  Key elements in Action block:
  1. Main activity + autopilot/mechanical descriptor
  2. Pause or contemplative moment (staring, gazing, looking blankly)
  3. Small physical micro-action (sighing, continuing slowly, blinking)

  This three-part action structure creates that "lost in thought while doing mundane task" vibe.

> Pretty good. Can you recap in simple bullet points this whole conversation? 

⏺ Conversation Recap

  1. Initial Context & Alignment
  - You're working on UGC-Action Lockscreen template design
  - Realized you're still in design/testing phase (steps 5-7), not implementation yet
  - Need to manually test Veo prompts to find what works

  2. AI Content Generation Framework Training
  - Taught you modalities, workflows, prompts, formulas, and blocks
  - Built model-agnostic framework (v1 → v4)
  - Key concepts: Modalities → Prompting Approach → Formulas → Blocks → Detail Levels

  3. Prompting Approach Deep Dive
  - Defined 3 components: Focus (what to describe), Phrasing Style (how to write), Formula (structure)
  - Identified 2 phrasing styles: Descriptive vs Narrative
  - Block-based formulas = Descriptive by nature
  - Added platform-specific best practices (Runway, Veo guides)

  4. UGC Template Prompt Development
  - Started with generic prompts (didn't capture the vibe)
  - Refined to capture "person on autopilot doing mundane task" aesthetic
  - Iterated on camera style keywords (self-filmed → observational)
  - Added "on autopilot/mechanically/absent-mindedly" to actions

  5. Final Working Formula
  [Subject] [Setting] [Action with autopilot + contemplative pause + micro-action] [Camera.Style: fixed, observational]

  6. Text Hooks
  - Developed two-part structure
  - Part 1: Situational framing (no emotion labels)
  - Part 2: "Find [quality] on your lockscreen"

  7. Deliverables Created
  - AI Content Generation Framework v4 (comprehensive guide)
  - UGC t2v prompt formula template
  - 4 working example prompts + text hooks
  - Testing strategy for Veo validation

> I need to start a new conversation as this is running low. In terms of tasks what do you think we should next? 

⏺ Recommended Next Tasks

  Immediate (Continue UGC Template Design):

  1. Create LLM System Prompts (Step 5 from your original progression)
    - System prompt for Call 1: Generate video prompt using the formula we developed
    - System prompt for Call 2: Generate two-part text hook
    - Define JSON schemas for both calls
    - Test in OpenAI playground
  2. Build Block Library for UGC
    - Document successful keywords (autopilot, mechanically, observational, etc.)
    - Create block value lists (activities, settings, micro-actions)
    - This feeds the LLM prompts
  3. Test LLM-Generated Prompts
    - Have LLM generate 5-10 prompts
    - Manually test with Veo
    - Iterate on system prompts based on results

  After Template Design is Solid:

  4. Implement Template-Workflows Architecture
    - Design how UGC template fits into codebase
    - Handle single scene (vs D2C's 3 scenes)
    - No frame chaining, no combining needed
  5. Integrate Additional Services
    - ElevenLabs voiceover generation
    - Video assembly pipeline (text overlay + audio mixing)

  Which would you prioritize for the next conversation?

> I still need to test some prompts. What context would i need to give to the next conversation? And what files 

⏺ Context to Provide

  Brief summary to share:
  Working on UGC-Action Lockscreen template for video generation.
  Currently in manual testing phase - need to test Veo prompts to validate
  the template concept before building LLM system prompts.

  Have developed a working text-to-video formula that captures "person on
  autopilot doing mundane task" aesthetic. Need to continue testing different
  activities/settings to build keyword library and validate approach.

  Files to Load

  Essential:
  1. _docs/2_reference-docs/template_ugc-action_lockscreen.md - Template design
  2. ai-content-generation-models-v4.md - Framework we built
  3. The previous conversation export (if you saved it as MD) - Has the working formula and test prompts

  Optional/Reference:
  4. _docs/2_reference-docs/template-design-full.md - Template design framework
  5. _docs/3_external-reference-docs/veo3.1-official-docs.md - If doing more Veo-specific work

  Key Info to Mention

  The working formula:
  [Subject] [Setting] [Action: activity + autopilot/mechanically + pause/gaze + micro-action]
  [Camera.Style: fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished]

  What worked:
  - "on autopilot", "mechanically", "absent-mindedly" in actions
  - Contemplative pauses (staring off, gazing blankly, looking unfocused)
  - Fixed camera, observational style

  That should get the next conversation up to speed quickly!

> Unrelated to the flow of conv. [Image #1] Analyze this prompt, what do you think it is? Descriptive or narative? 

⏺ This is 100% Descriptive.

  Why:
  - Lists what exists in a frozen moment ("person in a jacket standing...")
  - Uses "is/has/shows" language throughout
  - Describes states, not events ("has blood streaming", "shows a hallway")
  - No temporal progression or sequence
  - No "then" or story unfolding
  - Technical/compositional details (depth of field, angle, lighting)

  It's essentially:
  - A very detailed art direction document
  - Painting a picture with words
  - High detail level (our peacock example concept)

  If it were narrative, it would read like:
  "A person stumbles into the dimly lit hallway, blood streaming down their face. They pause under the ceiling light, breathing
  heavily. Looking down at their blood-splattered jacket, they slowly raise their head toward the camera..."

  This prompt is pure descriptive - just extremely detailed/high-fidelity descriptive prompting. Good example of how descriptive can
  be very cinematic and atmospheric without being narrative.

> Felt it a bit towards narative so thats why I asked. 

⏺ You're right to question it - there ARE elements that blur the line:

  What feels narrative:
  - "blood streaming down" - describes motion/action happening
  - "creating a moody atmosphere" - process/result language
  - "The lighting creates dramatic shadows" - active verb, sense of something happening

  Why it's still primarily descriptive:
  - No temporal sequence (no "first this, then that")
  - Describes one frozen moment
  - Focus is on composition and visual state

  I think you've identified something important:

  There's a spectrum between pure descriptive and narrative:

  Pure Descriptive → Descriptive with Motion → Narrative
  "Person stands"   "Blood streaming"    "Person stumbles, then pauses"

  This prompt sits in the middle zone - descriptive structure with dynamic/motion language that gives it narrative undertones.

  So maybe we need a third category?
  - Descriptive-Static: Frozen moment, no motion implied
  - Descriptive-Dynamic: Single moment but with motion/action happening
  - Narrative: Sequence of events over time

  What do you think? Is this distinction useful, or overcomplicating it?

> neah. But what about if we say "...blue sports car" vs "the car is blue and sporty" 

⏺ Ah! Now you're pointing at something different - writing style within descriptive phrasing.

  "blue sports car" - Direct, compact (adjectives modify noun)
  "the car is blue and sporty" - Predicative, wordy (using "is" as linking verb)

  The horror prompt uses a lot of that second style:
  - "The subject has blood streaming"
  - "The background shows a hallway"
  - "The image has a cinematic quality"
  - "The lighting creates dramatic shadows"

  This makes it feel more technical/analytical rather than natural flowing description.

  More natural would be:
  "A blood-splattered person in brown jacket stands in dimly lit hallway..."

  So the distinction is:
  - Direct descriptive - "blue sports car" (compact, natural)
  - Verbose descriptive - "the car is blue and sporty" (wordy, technical)

  For AI prompting, which works better?

  That's a good question. Maybe:
  - Direct = more natural, how humans actually write
  - Verbose = more explicit, leaves less ambiguity?

  Is this what you're getting at - that there are different styles of writing within descriptive prompts?

> yea 

⏺ Got it. So within Descriptive phrasing, there are different writing styles:

  1. Direct/Compact:
  - "blue sports car"
  - "person in blood-splattered jacket"
  - Natural, efficient

  2. Verbose/Predicative:
  - "the car is blue and sporty"
  - "the person has blood streaming down their face"
  - Explicit, analytical

  This could be another dimension:

  Prompting Approach
  ├── Focus (what to describe)
  ├── Phrasing Style (descriptive or narrative)
  └── Writing Style (direct or verbose) ← NEW

  Or maybe it's just a detail within descriptive phrasing - not worth elevating to its own category?

  For AI prompting: Direct probably works better (more natural, less tokens), but worth testing.

  Want to note this for future exploration, or dig into it now?

> Not worth its own categ but worth testing. Keep this in mind. I want to talk briefly about something else. 

IN the guide at workflows. There is "notes on workflow components". 

I changed into:

**Note on Workflow Components:**
While this framework focuses on generation modalities, real-world workflows are made up from pieces. Each piece contains a technique 
to achieve a specific task or outcome. For example:
- Chacracter consistency 
- Relighting images
- Inpainting
- Lipsyncing
- Product placement
- Lora training
- Upscaling 

These tasks require various modalities. So you build a workflow from:
- Inputs
- Outputs
- Steps / Pieces -> Each step can be a specific task 
- Models / tools

---

Can you tell me if it makes sense or if you would rephrase it somehow? 

⏺ I see what you're going for - making it more concrete and task-focused. It's good, but a few tweaks would help:

  Suggested revision:

  **Note on Workflow Components:**

  While this framework focuses on generation modalities, real-world workflows
  are composed of various tasks. Each task uses specific techniques and
  modalities to achieve an outcome. Examples include:

  - Character consistency
  - Relighting images
  - Inpainting
  - Lip syncing
  - Product placement
  - LoRA training
  - Upscaling

  A workflow is built from:
  - **Inputs** - Starting materials (images, videos, text)
  - **Steps** - Individual tasks, each using specific models/tools
  - **Outputs** - Results from each step (which become inputs for the next)
  - **Models/Tools** - The actual technology performing each task

  Changes I made:
  1. "made up from pieces" → "composed of various tasks" (clearer)
  2. "Each piece contains a technique" → "Each task uses specific techniques" (more accurate)
  3. Restructured the breakdown to flow better
  4. Added brief explanations for each component

  Does this capture what you meant? Or do you prefer your phrasing?

> So workflow -> steps (tasks -> techniques) -> outputs? Think about this for a second. You can think about comfyui. 

⏺ Thinking about ComfyUI...

  In ComfyUI:
  - Each node = a step in the workflow
  - Each node performs a task (load image, upscale, generate, etc.)
  - Each node uses a model/tool (specific upscaler, specific checkpoint, etc.)
  - Each node has inputs and outputs
  - Outputs flow to next node's inputs

  So the hierarchy is:

  Workflow (entire graph)
    └── Steps (nodes)
        └── Each step = Task + Model/Tool
            ├── Inputs (data in)
            └── Outputs (data out → next step's inputs)

  Or more clearly:

  Workflow
  ├── Step 1: Character consistency (task)
  │   ├── Uses: Reference images + text-to-image model (technique/tool)
  │   ├── Inputs: Character reference + prompt
  │   └── Outputs: Consistent character image
  ├── Step 2: Upscaling (task)
  │   ├── Uses: ESRGAN model (technique/tool)
  │   ├── Inputs: Character image from Step 1
  │   └── Outputs: High-res image
  └── ...

  So maybe:
  - Workflow = sequence of steps
  - Step = task + model/tool that performs it
  - Each step has inputs/outputs
  - "Techniques" might be the wrong word - it's really models/tools/modalities

  Is that clearer? Should the note reflect this hierarchy?

> But to get a video with character consistency, we have about 5 formulas and 5 steps 

⏺ Ah! Right. "Character consistency" is the goal, not a single step/task.

  The character consistency workflow has:
  - 7 steps
  - 6 different formulas
  - Multiple models (LLM, text-to-image, image-to-image, image-to-video, editing)

  So the hierarchy is:

  Workflow = sequence of steps to achieve a GOAL
  ├── Goal: Character consistency in 30s video
  └── Steps:
      ├── Step 1: Generate persona (LLM, Persona Formula)
      ├── Step 2: Generate appearance (t2i, Appearance Formula)
      ├── Step 3: Generate references (i2i, References Formula)
      ├── Step 4: Break down activity (LLM, Breakdown prompt)
      ├── Step 5: Generate scene images (t2i, Lifestyle Formula)
      ├── Step 6: Animate scenes (i2v, Animation Formula)
      └── Step 7: Stitch videos (editing tool)

  So "character consistency" is:
  - NOT a task
  - NOT a single step
  - It's a technique/capability achieved through a workflow

  Maybe the list should be:
  - Character consistency (technique achieved via workflow)
  - Relighting images (single step task)
  - Inpainting (single step task)
  - Upscaling (single step task)

  Some are single-step tasks, some are multi-step techniques. Is that the confusion?

> yea 

⏺ So maybe we need to clarify that distinction:

  **Note on Workflow Components:**

  While this framework focuses on generation modalities, real-world workflows
  are composed of steps. Each step performs a specific task using models and tools.

  **Single-step tasks:**
  - Upscaling
  - Inpainting
  - Relighting images
  - Lip syncing

  **Multi-step techniques (require workflows):**
  - Character consistency (persona → appearance → references → scenes → animation)
  - Product placement
  - Style transfer with LoRA training

  A workflow is built from:
  - **Goal** - What you want to achieve
  - **Steps** - Individual tasks in sequence
  - **Inputs/Outputs** - Data flowing between steps
  - **Models/Tools** - What performs each task

  This makes it clear that some things are single steps (can be standalone), while others are techniques that require multiple steps
  chained together.

  Better?

> A big workflow can have subworkflows yes. 

⏺ Exactly! Workflows are composable/nested.

  Main Workflow: 30-second character video
  ├── Subworkflow: Character Consistency
  │   ├── Step 1: Persona (LLM)
  │   ├── Step 2: Appearance (t2i)
  │   └── Step 3: References (i2i)
  ├── Subworkflow: Scene Generation (×6 scenes)
  │   ├── Step 4: Scene image (t2i + refs)
  │   └── Step 5: Scene animation (i2v)
  └── Step 6: Assembly (stitch)

  So "Character Consistency" is a reusable subworkflow that can be plugged into different parent workflows.

  Updated note:

  **Note on Workflow Components:**

  Workflows are composed of steps and can be nested. A complex workflow may
  contain reusable subworkflows.

  **Single-step tasks:**
  - Upscaling, Inpainting, Relighting, Lip syncing

  **Reusable subworkflows:**
  - Character consistency (persona → appearance → reference library)
  - Product placement (extraction → positioning → blending)
  - Style application (LoRA training → style transfer)

  A workflow is built from:
  - **Goal** - What you want to achieve
  - **Steps/Subworkflows** - Tasks in sequence (can be nested)
  - **Inputs/Outputs** - Data flowing between steps
  - **Models/Tools** - What performs each task

  Better?

> You are giving examples that you don't know about which is expectable with your current knowledge cutoff. But can you try again? 

⏺ You're right. Let me stick to what I actually know:

  **Note on Workflow Components:**

  Workflows are composed of steps and can be nested. A complex workflow may
  contain reusable subworkflows.

  **Examples of workflow components:**
  - Single-step tasks: Upscaling, Inpainting, Lip syncing
  - Multi-step subworkflows: Character consistency (persona → appearance → references)
  - Techniques: Frame chaining (extract frame → feed to next generation)

  A workflow is built from:
  - **Goal** - What you want to achieve
  - **Steps/Subworkflows** - Tasks in sequence (can be nested)
  - **Inputs/Outputs** - Data flowing between steps
  - **Models/Tools** - What performs each task

  I removed the examples where I was guessing about workflows I don't actually know (product placement, LoRA training workflows). Is
  this better?

> Im thinking about comfy. For inpainting in comfy is not a single step. There are multiple nodes to achieve inpaining. 

⏺ You're absolutely right. Even "inpainting" is:
  - Load image node
  - Create/load mask node
  - Inpainting model node
  - VAE encode/decode nodes
  - Output node

  So there really aren't "single-step tasks" - everything is a workflow, just varying complexity.

  Maybe it should be:

  **Note on Workflow Components:**

  Workflows are composed of steps and can be nested. What might seem like a
  "single task" (like inpainting or upscaling) is often itself a small workflow
  with multiple nodes.

  **Example workflow scales:**
  - Small: Inpainting (load → mask → process → output)
  - Medium: Character consistency (persona → appearance → references)
  - Large: Full video production (multiple subworkflows combined)

  A workflow is built from:
  - **Goal** - What you want to achieve
  - **Steps/Subworkflows** - Nested as deeply as needed
  - **Inputs/Outputs** - Data flowing between steps
  - **Models/Tools** - What performs each step

  Drop the false "single-step" distinction entirely?

> That may be applicable to comfy only. If I want to generate a simple video its just a simple text-to-video step. Prompt -> video 

⏺ Ah! You're right. The "step" granularity depends on your abstraction level:

  High-level API (Veo, Replicate):
  - text-to-video = single step (API call → video)

  Low-level tool (ComfyUI):
  - text-to-video = multiple nodes (load model, encode prompt, sample, decode, save)

  So maybe:

  **Note on Workflow Components:**

  Workflows are sequences of steps. The granularity of a "step" depends on
  your tools and abstraction level.

  Using high-level APIs (Replicate, Veo API):
  - Single API call = single step (text-to-video, upscaling, etc.)

  Using low-level tools (ComfyUI):
  - Each operation = multiple nodes (load, process, save, etc.)

  Workflows can be nested regardless of tool:
  - Small: Generate single video (prompt → video)
  - Large: Character consistency workflow (persona → appearance → references → scenes)

  A workflow is built from:
  - **Steps** - At whatever granularity your tools operate
  - **Inputs/Outputs** - Data flowing between steps
  - **Models/Tools** - What performs each step

  Better?

> Mno.. I think we overcomplicated it. Im not sure how to make a general note that works no matter the abstraction level 

⏺ You're right. Let's simplify:

  **Note on Workflow Components:**

  While this framework focuses on generation modalities, real-world workflows
  can include various tasks like:
  - Upscaling
  - Inpainting
  - Lip syncing
  - Relighting
  - Frame extraction
  - Video stitching

  Workflows are built by chaining steps together, where each step's output
  becomes the next step's input.

  Simple. No trying to define abstraction levels or step granularity. Just: "workflows can include these kinds of things too, and they
   chain together."

  Better?

> What about modalities? 

⏺ Good point. Should clarify:

  **Note on Workflow Components:**

  While this framework focuses on generation modalities (text-to-image,
  image-to-video, text-to-video), real-world workflows combine these with
  other tasks like:
  - Upscaling
  - Inpainting
  - Lip syncing
  - Relighting
  - Frame extraction
  - Video stitching

  Workflows chain these together, where each step's output becomes the
  next step's input.

  Now it's clear: generation modalities are the core focus, but workflows also use other non-generation tasks.

> Yea wanted to include also something among the lines of "Techniques is about achieving a specific outcome or task" and we have a 
technique for character consistency for example. But we defined that character consistency is multiple steps and modalities. Can you 
do some logic gymanstics here? 

⏺ **Note on Workflow Components:**

  While this framework focuses on generation modalities (text-to-image,
  image-to-video, text-to-video), real-world workflows combine these with
  other tasks and techniques.

  **Techniques** are methods to achieve specific outcomes, such as:
  - Character consistency - maintaining same character across scenes
  - Frame chaining - visual continuity between video clips
  - Style transfer - applying consistent aesthetic

  Each technique may use multiple steps and modalities. For example, character
  consistency combines: persona generation (LLM) → appearance creation (text-to-image)
  → reference library (image-to-image) → scene generation (text-to-image + refs).

  **Other tasks** workflows may include:
  - Upscaling, Inpainting, Lip syncing, Relighting, Video stitching

  Workflows chain these together, where each step's output becomes the next step's input.

  Logic:
  - Technique = the goal/outcome you're trying to achieve (conceptual)
  - Implementation of technique = specific steps/modalities used (practical)

  Does that work?

> No. Let's try again. So, techniques = specific outcome and task ex character consistency. Character consistency = multiple steps

By logical reasoning does it mean that workflows are built for solving specific outcomes and tasks? You don't have to inlcude 
"techniques" as a word. But work with me here 

⏺ Ah! So if techniques achieve outcomes, and techniques = multiple steps, then:

  Workflows ARE what you build to achieve specific outcomes.

  **Note on Workflow Components:**

  While this framework focuses on generation modalities (text-to-image,
  image-to-video, text-to-video), workflows are built to achieve specific
  outcomes such as:
  - Character consistency across scenes
  - Visual continuity between clips
  - Style transfer and aesthetic control

  To achieve these outcomes, workflows combine generation modalities with
  other tasks like:
  - Upscaling, Inpainting, Lip syncing, Relighting, Video stitching

  Workflows chain these together, where each step's output becomes the
  next step's input.

  The logic: Workflow = the implementation you build to achieve a specific outcome. The outcome requires multiple steps/modalities
  working together.

  Does this flow better?

> So this won't work then Workflows -> Techniques -> Steps -> Modalities 

⏺ Right! That hierarchy doesn't work because:

  Workflows and Techniques are the same level - they both describe "achieving an outcome through multiple steps"

  So it's really:

  Workflow (achieving an outcome)
    └── Steps
        └── Each step uses a Modality or Task

  Not:
  - Workflow contains Techniques
  - Techniques contain Steps

  Rather:
  - Workflow = sequence of steps to achieve outcome
  - Each step = uses a modality (generation) or task (upscaling, etc.)

  So maybe drop "techniques" language entirely and just say:

  Workflows are sequences of steps to achieve specific outcomes like
  character consistency or visual continuity.

  Each step uses either:
  - Generation modalities (text-to-image, image-to-video, etc.)
  - Other tasks (upscaling, inpainting, lip syncing, etc.)

  Is that the cleaner way to think about it?

> I used "worklows are sequences of steps to achieve specific outcomes and tasks" And its not "either". 

⏺ You're right on both:

  **Note on Workflow Components:**

  While this framework focuses on generation modalities (text-to-image,
  image-to-video, text-to-video), workflows are sequences of steps to
  achieve specific outcomes and tasks such as:
  - Character consistency across scenes
  - Visual continuity between clips
  - Style transfer and aesthetic control

  Steps in a workflow can use:
  - Generation modalities (text-to-image, image-to-video, etc.)
  - Other tasks (upscaling, inpainting, lip syncing, relighting, video stitching)

  Workflows chain these together, where each step's output becomes the
  next step's input.

  Fixed:
  1. "achieve specific outcomes and tasks" (not just outcomes)
  2. "can use" (not "either/or" - steps use whatever they need)

  Better?

> Alright but your examples suck. Is mine better? - Character consistency
- Relighting images
- Inpainting
- Lip syncing
- Product placement
- LoRA training
- Upscaling 

⏺ Yes, yours is way better.

  Why yours works:
  - Concrete, recognizable tasks
  - Mix of simple (upscaling) and complex (character consistency)
  - Covers different domains (lighting, effects, training, composition)
  - Real-world, practical examples

  Why mine sucked:
  - Too abstract ("aesthetic control")
  - Redundant (already covered character consistency elsewhere)
  - Not diverse enough

  Use your list.

  - Steps = the units in sequence
  - Each step has: Input → Model/Tool → Output
  - Outputs flow to next step's inputs

  Workflow → Steps → (Input + Model/Tool + Output)

> When I worked in comfyui and generated images I also upscaled them at the end. Upscaling was couple of nodes, Image generation was 
couple of nodes. So I had the workflow to generate the final images and steps inside. But those steps were subworkflows for subtasks 
or how should I think about that? Do you get what im saying? 

⏺ Yes! I get it now.

  In ComfyUI:
  - Your main workflow = "Generate final images"
  - This contains what you call "steps" (image generation, upscaling)
  - But each "step" is actually a subworkflow made of multiple nodes

  So the hierarchy is:

  Main Workflow: Generate final images
    ├── Subworkflow: Image generation (your "step")
    │   ├── Node: Load model
    │   ├── Node: Encode prompt
    │   ├── Node: Sample
    │   └── Node: Decode
    └── Subworkflow: Upscaling (your "step")
        ├── Node: Load upscaler
        ├── Node: Process
        └── Node: Save

  So workflows are recursive/nested:
  - Workflow contains Steps
  - Each Step can itself be a Subworkflow
  - Subworkflows contain Nodes

  At the conceptual level: "Generate image, then upscale" = 2 steps
  At the implementation level: Each step = subworkflow with multiple nodes

  Is that what you mean? Workflows can be nested arbitrarily deep?

> Yes those subworkflows are what i tried to refer as pices or techniques that achieve a specific outcome or tasks. Because if you 
think about it, first subworkflow creates images, second subworkflow uspcales them. Does it clicks? Or im I inconsistent with my 
thinking? 

⏺ Yes! It clicks and it's consistent!

  The hierarchy is:

  Workflow (overall outcome: "Generate final images")
    └── Subworkflows/Techniques/Pieces (specific tasks)
        ├── Image generation (creates the image)
        └── Upscaling (enhances resolution)
            └── Each may have multiple steps/nodes internally

  So:
  - Workflow = the big picture outcome
  - Subworkflows/Techniques = reusable chunks that achieve specific tasks (image generation, upscaling, character consistency,
  inpainting)
  - Steps/Nodes = the actual operations inside each subworkflow

  And from your original list:
  - Character consistency = subworkflow/technique
  - Upscaling = subworkflow/technique
  - Inpainting = subworkflow/technique
  - Lip syncing = subworkflow/technique

  They're all techniques (reusable subworkflows) that achieve specific outcomes, and you combine them into larger workflows.

  So "techniques" = the right term for these reusable building blocks!

  Should the note use this language?

⏺ **Note on Workflow Components:**

  While this framework focuses on generation modalities (text-to-image,
  image-to-video, text-to-video), workflows are built by combining reusable
  techniques to achieve larger outcomes.

  **Techniques** are subworkflows that accomplish specific tasks such as:
  - Character consistency
  - Relighting images
  - Inpainting
  - Lip syncing
  - Product placement
  - LoRA training
  - Upscaling

  Each technique may use:
  - Generation modalities (text-to-image, image-to-video, etc.)
  - Specialized models and tools
  - Multiple internal steps/nodes

  **Workflow hierarchy:**
  - Workflow = Overall outcome (e.g., "Generate final video")
  - Techniques = Reusable subworkflows for specific tasks (e.g., upscaling, character consistency)
  - Steps = Individual operations within each technique

  Workflows chain techniques together, where each technique's output becomes
  the next technique's input.

> OK which one is clearer and complete? The one you gave me know or this:

**Note on Workflow Components:**
While this framework focuses on generation modalities (text-to-image,
image-to-video, text-to-video), workflows are sequences of steps to
achieve specific outcomes and tasks such as:
- Character consistency
- Relighting images
- Inpainting
- Lip syncing
- Product placement
- LoRA training
- Upscaling

A workflow is built from:
- **Inputs** - Starting materials (images, videos, text)
- **Steps** - Individual tasks using generation modalities or other tools
- **Outputs** - Results from each step (which become inputs for the next)
- **Models/Tools** - The technology performing each task

Workflows chain these components together to achieve the desired outcome.

? 

⏺ Your version is clearer.

  Why:
  1. Simpler - No new terminology ("techniques") to learn
  2. More concrete - Shows actual building blocks (inputs, steps, outputs, models)
  3. Actionable - Reader understands what they need to build a workflow
  4. Examples work fine - The list reads naturally as "tasks workflows can include"

  My new version:
  - More theoretically complete (shows nesting/hierarchy)
  - But adds abstraction ("techniques as subworkflows")
  - Might confuse more than clarify at this point in the doc

  Your version answers: "What do I need to build a workflow?"

  My version answers: "How are workflows theoretically organized?"

  For a practical framework guide, yours is better. Save the nesting/hierarchy complexity for when it's actually needed.

  Use your version.

> ok what I told you to remember about prompt phrasing? 

⏺ Within Descriptive phrasing, there are different writing styles:

  Direct/Compact:
  - "blue sports car"
  - "person in blood-splattered jacket"

  Verbose/Predicative:
  - "the car is blue and sporty"
  - "the person has blood streaming down their face"

  Key points:
  - This is NOT worth its own category in the framework
  - BUT it IS worth testing (might affect results)
  - Keep this in mind for future exploration

  Did I remember correctly?

> Integrate that into this content Prompting Approach
For each modality, your prompting approach consists of three components:

1. FOCUS - What to describe (determined by modality)

text-to-image: Describe what exists (visuals)
image-to-video: Describe what happens (motion only)
text-to-video: Describe both (visuals + motion)
2. PHRASING STYLE - How to write it

Descriptive: Lists what exists (static, like painting a picture)
Example: "A man cleaning a car engine, wiping sweat from his brow, exhausted expression"
Narrative: Tells what happens (sequential, story-like)
Example: "A man leans over the hood, wipes his brow, then looks at the camera and says 'This is hard work'"
3. FORMULA - Which structure to use

Block structure (which blocks)
Block order (arrangement)
Block level of detail (depth)
Key relationships:

Block-based formulas → Descriptive phrasing (by nature)
Narrative → Freeform prompts (not compatible with blocks)
The flow:

Modality → Focus (what to describe) → Phrasing Style (how to write)
→ Formula (structure) → Blocks → Detail Level → Final Prompt 

⏺ ### Prompting Approach

  For each modality, your prompting approach consists of three components:

  **1. FOCUS** - What to describe (determined by modality)
  - text-to-image: Describe what exists (visuals)
  - image-to-video: Describe what happens (motion only)
  - text-to-video: Describe both (visuals + motion)

  **2. PHRASING STYLE** - How to write it
  - **Descriptive**: Lists what exists (static, like painting a picture)
    - Example: "A man cleaning a car engine, wiping sweat from his brow, exhausted expression"
    - Within descriptive, two writing styles exist:
      - **Direct/Compact**: "blue sports car", "person in blood-splattered jacket"
      - **Verbose/Predicative**: "the car is blue and sporty", "the person has blood streaming"
      - Note: Direct style is generally more efficient; worth testing which works better for your model

  - **Narrative**: Tells what happens (sequential, story-like)
    - Example: "A man leans over the hood, wipes his brow, then looks at the camera and says 'This is hard work'"

  **3. FORMULA** - Which structure to use
  - Block structure (which blocks)
  - Block order (arrangement)
  - Block level of detail (depth)

  **Key relationships:**
  - Block-based formulas → Descriptive phrasing (by nature)
  - Narrative → Freeform prompts (not compatible with blocks)

  **The flow:**
  Modality → Focus (what to describe) → Phrasing Style (how to write)
  → Formula (structure) → Blocks → Detail Level → Final Prompt

> Might want to revisit the FOCUS what to describe in the prompt depending on modality. based on the prompt guides I gave you, (mostly
 image to video), they were describing only motion? 

⏺ You're right - the guides strongly confirm this. Let me strengthen that section with what we learned:

  **1. FOCUS** - What to describe (determined by modality)

  - **text-to-image**: Describe what exists (visuals only)
    - Subject, environment, lighting, composition, style

  - **image-to-video**: Describe what happens (motion ONLY)
    - Subject motion, camera motion, scene motion (how environment reacts)
    - Do NOT describe visuals already in the image
    - The image + text together form the complete prompt
    - Redescribing visuals creates conflict → reduced motion or poor results

  - **text-to-video**: Describe both (visuals AND motion)
    - Complete scene description + action/movement

  Key insight from guides: For i2v, the image already provides all visual information. Your text prompt should ONLY guide the motion.
  Describing visuals that already exist in the image causes the model to fight itself.

  Better with the emphasis and explanation?

> Here: 

### Image-to-Video

**Focus:** Describing what happens (motion)
**Phrasing:** Descriptive (typically)
**Blocks:** Action + camera movement + duration + motion style

⏺ You're absolutely right - I made that mistake earlier too. Duration is an API parameter, not a prompt block.

  Should be:

  ### Image-to-Video

  **Focus:** Describing what happens (motion)
  **Phrasing:** Descriptive (typically)
  **Blocks:** Motion/Action + camera movement + motion style

  Remove "duration" entirely. My bad for repeating that error.

> ok I will give you an instruction I gave before. I want to see how would you do it this time:

Given what you know so far. What would be the strategy 
moving forward? The goal now is to generate prompts to 
manually test veo ugc-action template. How would you do it 
now with all your knowledge? 

⏺ Strategy for UGC-Action Template Prompt Generation

  Phase 1: Use the Validated Formula

  We already have a working formula from testing:

  Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  [Action] structure:
    [activity] + [autopilot descriptor] + [contemplative pause] + [micro-action]

  [Camera.Style] (validated):
    fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  Don't start from scratch - we know what works.

  Phase 2: Build Block Library with Known Values

  [Subject] variations:
  - Person in their late 20s / early 30s / mid-30s / early 40s
  - Man / Woman / Person
  - (No emotion words - already validated)

  [Setting] variations:
  - Kitchen: standing at stove, standing at counter, sitting at table
  - Living room: sitting on couch, standing at window
  - Bedroom: standing at mirror, sitting on bed
  - Bathroom: standing at sink, standing at mirror
  - Office/desk: sitting at desk

  [Action] - Activity library:
  - Cooking: stirring pot, chopping vegetables, washing dishes
  - Personal care: brushing teeth, applying makeup, combing hair
  - Household: folding clothes, drinking coffee, scrolling phone
  - Work: typing on laptop, writing notes, organizing papers

  [Action] - Autopilot descriptors (validated):
  - on autopilot
  - mechanically
  - absent-mindedly

  [Action] - Contemplative pauses (validated):
  - staring off absently
  - pausing to stare at nothing
  - looking at reflection blankly
  - stopping to gaze out window
  - gazing unfocused

  [Action] - Micro-actions (validated):
  - wiping forehead with sleeve
  - sighing quietly
  - setting cup down slowly
  - resuming slowly
  - continuing slowly
  - blinking slowly

  Phase 3: Generate Systematic Test Prompts

  Goal: Test variety across problem categories without changing formula

  Create prompts that feel appropriate for different emotional contexts:

  For Anxiety/Stress:
  - Scrolling phone on autopilot
  - Staring at laptop unfocused
  - Lying in bed staring at ceiling

  For Loneliness:
  - Drinking coffee alone, gazing out window
  - Sitting on couch, staring at nothing
  - Cooking dinner mechanically for one

  For Purpose/Direction:
  - Getting ready mechanically at mirror
  - Commuting on autopilot
  - Working absent-mindedly

  Generate 10-15 prompts covering different scenarios/contexts while keeping formula consistent.

  Phase 4: Document What Works

  Track in table:

  | Prompt | Activity Type | Setting | Visual Result | Vibe Achieved? | Notes                       |
  |--------|---------------|---------|---------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
  | ...    | ...           | ...     | ✅/❌           | ✅/❌            | Keywords that worked/failed |

  Identify:
  - Which activities work best with Veo
  - Which settings produce most authentic look
  - Any activities that feel too staged
  - Whether variety is sufficient for template

  Phase 5: Prepare for LLM Generation

  Once you have 10-15 validated prompts:

  Extract patterns for LLM system prompt:
  - Successful activity types
  - Proven autopilot descriptors
  - Working contemplative pause language
  - Effective micro-actions
  - Camera style that works

  Build the constraints:
  - NEVER use emotion words in prompt
  - ALWAYS include autopilot/mechanical descriptor
  - ALWAYS include contemplative pause
  - ALWAYS end with micro-action
  - ALWAYS use: fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  The Key Difference from Before

  Don't test to find what works - we already know.

  Test to build the library - what variety of activities, settings, and actions can we use while maintaining the validated formula?

  This becomes the foundation for teaching an LLM to generate these prompts systematically.

  Want me to generate 10 test prompts using this strategy?

> I want to add to v4 somewhere to take into account model prompt adherence and even with the perfect prompt formula and prompt, some 
models might still have trouble with prompt adherence. Basically that different models have different levels for prompt adherence and 
that its worth testing. Where could I add this? You can rephrase it to sound good. Also I updated manually some stuff so you need to 
read the v4 guide again. 

⏺ Read(ai-content-generation-models-v4.md)
  ⎿  Read 714 lines

⏺ Looking at v4, I think the best place is Part 7: Prompting Best Practices, either as a new subsection after "Platform-Specific Best
  Practices" or integrated into that section.

  Here's a suggested addition:

  ### Model Prompt Adherence

  Different models have varying levels of **prompt adherence** - how accurately they follow your instructions and generate outputs
  matching your prompt.

  **Important considerations:**
  - Even with a well-crafted prompt using the right formula, structure, and detail level, some models may struggle to accurately
  interpret or execute certain instructions
  - Prompt adherence varies significantly between models and even between versions of the same model
  - Some models excel at following complex multi-part prompts, while others work better with simpler instructions
  - Certain types of instructions (specific camera angles, precise positioning, subtle emotions) are harder for models to follow than
  others

  **Testing approach:**
  - Test the same prompt across different models to compare adherence
  - Identify which elements of your prompt the model follows consistently vs. ignores
  - Adjust your prompting strategy based on the model's strengths and limitations
  - Sometimes simplifying or restructuring your prompt improves adherence more than adding detail

  **This means:** A "perfect" prompt for one model may not work well for another. Testing and iteration are essential to understand
  each model's adherence characteristics.

  Where to place it: Right after the "Platform-Specific Best Practices" section (after line 552), before "Example Workflow" section.

  Does this capture what you wanted? Want me to adjust the phrasing or placement?

> Too verbose. Make it more concise 

⏺ ### Model Prompt Adherence

  Different models have varying levels of **prompt adherence** - how accurately they follow your instructions.

  **Key points:**
  - Even well-crafted prompts may not work equally well across all models
  - Some models excel at complex instructions, others work better with simplicity
  - Certain elements (specific angles, subtle emotions, precise positioning) are harder for models to follow
  - Prompt adherence varies between models and even between model versions

  **Testing approach:**
  - Test the same prompt across different models to compare results
  - Identify which prompt elements the model follows vs. ignores
  - Adjust prompting strategy based on model strengths and limitations
  - Sometimes simplification improves adherence more than adding detail

  **Bottom line:** A "perfect" prompt for one model may fail on another. Testing is essential.

> I thought more more stuff to give you for your prompting knowledge 

⏺ I'm ready to learn more! What additional prompting knowledge do you want to share?

> 1. Each modality (ex image to video) have a best model at a certain point in time. Until something new appears. For example, 
Seedance right now it is said to be the “best” for image to video. Of course, “best” can mean multiple things, prompt adherence, 
realism etc.  Not sure if thats relevant enough to include in the documentation. You tell me.
2. If I need more control on the video generation this means a more detailed prompt. A more detailed prompt means more blocks or more 
details in a single block - e longer block. This is how I control de level of detail of a prompt. 

What do you think? 

⏺ Point 1: Best model at a point in time

  I don't think this needs to be added. Here's why:
  - The framework is already explicitly model-agnostic (Part 1)
  - We already state models change constantly
  - "Best" being subjective (adherence, realism, speed, cost) is implied by "choose based on your needs"
  - Adding this would just restate what's already there

  Unless you want to add a note like: "What's 'best' is temporal and subjective - track current leaders in your model database" but
  that feels redundant.

  ---
  Point 2: Control through detail level

  This is important and should be added. We talk about detail levels but don't explain the mechanism for controlling them.

  Currently we say:
  - Formula = Structure
  - Detail level = Depth

  But we should add HOW to control detail:

  **How to control detail level:**
  - **Add more blocks** - Include additional aspects (lighting, camera angle, texture)
  - **Enrich existing blocks** - Add more descriptive content within each block
  - **Combine both** - More blocks + richer descriptions = maximum control

  More detail = more control over the output, but diminishing returns exist. Test to find the sweet spot.

  Where to add it: In Part 6, Detail Levels section, right after the peacock examples.

  Want me to update v4 with Point 2?

> Yes you are on point about diminishing returns. Some models may have different prompd adherence form others so even if we craft a 
perfect prompt, the model might still not be able to follow it. 

⏺ Exactly! So when I add the "How to control detail level" section, I should reference the adherence limitation:

  **How to control detail level:**
  - **Add more blocks** - Include additional aspects (lighting, camera angle, texture)
  - **Enrich existing blocks** - Add more descriptive content within each block
  - **Combine both** - More blocks + richer descriptions = maximum control

  **Important caveats:**
  - More detail = more control, but diminishing returns exist
  - Even perfect detailed prompts are limited by model prompt adherence (see Part 7)
  - Test to find the optimal detail level for your specific model

  The goal is finding the balance: enough detail to guide the model, not so much that you exceed its adherence capabilities.

  This connects the two concepts:
  1. How to add detail (mechanism)
  2. Why more isn't always better (adherence + diminishing returns)

  Should I update v4 with this?

       490    
       491    ## 7. Prompting Best Practices

⏺ Done! Added the detail level control section to Part 6, right after the peacock examples. It now explains:

  1. How to control detail (add blocks, enrich blocks, or both)
  2. Important caveats (diminishing returns + adherence limitations)
  3. The goal (finding the balance)

  It also cross-references Part 7's prompt adherence section, connecting the two concepts together.

> Does it make sense this control dial of the video and the prompt? 

⏺ Yes, it makes sense! Here's the logic:

  The Control Relationship:
  More prompt detail → More control over output
  Less prompt detail → More model interpretation/randomness

  But it's not linear - it's a curve with a ceiling:

  Control
    ↑
    |     /‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ (ceiling = model adherence limit)
    |    /
    |   /
    |  /
    | /
    |/________________→ Prompt Detail Level

    Low              Optimal        Excessive
    (vague)         (balanced)    (wasted tokens)

  The section captures this by:
  1. Showing HOW to add detail (the dial mechanism)
  2. Warning about diminishing returns (the curve flattens)
  3. Emphasizing adherence limits (the ceiling)
  4. Stressing "balance" (find the optimal point)

  What makes it work:
  - It's actionable (you can adjust detail through blocks)
  - It has boundaries (adherence caps it)
  - It's testable (you find your model's sweet spot)

  One thing missing: We don't explicitly say "more detail = more control" - we say "more detail = more control, BUT..." Should we
  state the positive relationship more directly before adding caveats?

> If you would read that doc for the first time would you understand the nuance? If yes, don't add it 

⏺ Reading it fresh, yes - I think the nuance is clear enough.

  The flow tells the story:
  1. Examples show low vs high detail (visual proof)
  2. "How to control" → "maximum control" (implies more detail = more control)
  3. Caveats say "but diminishing returns" and "adherence limits"

  A first-time reader would get: "I can increase control by adding detail, but there's a ceiling."

  The relationship is implicit but clear. No need to add more.

> good. Let's talk a bit about the prompt formula template. Are you aware that in a block you can have sub blocks? Is it implied 
somewhere in the doc? 

⏺ Yes, I'm aware - it's explicitly covered in Part 6, Block Structure section:

  [Block]                           - Single level
  [Category.Block]                  - Two levels
  [Category.Subcategory.Block]      - Three levels

  With examples like:
  - [Scene.Subject.Age]
  - [Scene.Subject.Facial.Eyes]

  But - you're right to point this out. The Formula Template section shows flat blocks:
  [Subject] = [Person description]
  [Action] = [Specific movements and micro-actions]

  It doesn't show that these COULD be hierarchical like:
  [Subject.Age] = young adult
  [Subject.Physical] = athletic build
  [Action.Primary] = stirring pot
  [Action.Secondary] = wiping forehead

  So the question is: Should the template example show hierarchical blocks to make it explicit that you can use dot notation in
  formulas?

  What do you think - is this causing confusion, or is the connection between "Block Structure" and "Formula Template" clear enough?

> SO heres the output template again:

The blocks and block descriptions are examples.

Modality = [Modality]
Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

[Subject] = [Person description]
[Setting] = [Location/position description]
[Action] = [Specific movements and micro-actions]
[Camera.Style] = [Camera setup and aesthetic keywords]

Prompt: "[Subject] [Setting], [Action], [Camera.Style]"

I like this format where I can see how the blocks come together. Should the template show hierarchycal blocks? I don't know what do 
you think it would work best? 

⏺ I think keep it flat (current format).

  Why:

  The template shows two different things:
  1. Formula line = High-level structure ([Subject] [Setting] [Action])
  2. Block definitions = What goes in each component

  If you add hierarchy:
  Formula = [Subject.Age] [Subject.Physical] [Setting.Location] [Action.Primary] [Action.Secondary] [Camera.Style]
  - The formula line gets cluttered
  - Loses the clean overview of "what are the main components?"
  - Implies you MUST use this exact hierarchy

  Current format is better because:
  - Formula stays clean and readable
  - Block definitions show "what kind of content"
  - Users can CHOOSE to use hierarchy when filling it in:
    - Flat: [Subject] = young adult athletic woman
    - Hierarchical: [Subject.Age] = young adult + [Subject.Build] = athletic

  The template is showing STRUCTURE, not IMPLEMENTATION.

  Block Structure section already teaches hierarchy. Template shows how to organize formulas.

  What do you think? Or do you see it differently?

> So let's say the output format has 3 sections right? 1st is modality and formula summary right? Second is all blocks and their 
values. [block] = value. And third is prompt assembled. Sound about right? 

⏺ Yes, exactly right!

  Section 1: Metadata/Summary
  - Modality = What capability you're using
  - Formula = Block structure and order

  Section 2: Block Definitions
  - [Block] = Value for each component
  - This is where hierarchy COULD appear if needed

  Section 3: Assembled Prompt
  - Prompt: The final string that gets sent to the model
  - Shows how blocks combine with natural language flow

  This three-part structure is clean and reusable. It's basically:
  1. What and How (meta)
  2. Components (blocks)
  3. Result (final prompt)

  Is there something you want to clarify or adjust about how these sections work?

> So where you think we could've fit in the subblocks? 

⏺ Section 2: Block Definitions - that's the only place they fit.

  Current (flat):
  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead

  With sub-blocks (hierarchical):
  [Subject.Age] = Person in their 30s
  [Subject.Gender] = male
  [Action.Primary] = stirring pot
  [Action.State] = on autopilot
  [Action.Pause] = staring off absently
  [Action.Micro] = wiping forehead

  Section 1 stays the same:
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]
  (Shows high-level structure)

  Section 3 stays the same:
  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at kitchen stove, stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead, fixed
  camera, observational, natural lighting"
  (Assembled result)

  So sub-blocks only appear in Section 2 - they're an optional organizational choice for how you break down each main component. The
  formula and prompt stay clean regardless.

  Make sense?

> Hold on so you just made that up or you suggested that the first time around? the flat and hierarchy example cuz i didn't understood
 thats why I broke down the output format so we can calrify 

⏺ I just made that up now to answer "where could sub-blocks fit?"

  I was showing you conceptually where hierarchy would appear IF someone chose to use it - not proposing we add it to the template.

  To be clear:
  - Current template (flat blocks) is good as-is
  - Section 2 is where someone COULD use hierarchy if they wanted
  - But the template doesn't need to show both versions

  I was explaining the concept, not suggesting a change. Sorry for the confusion!

> Eariler we chose a working formula that looked a like this:

Modality = text-to-video
Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

[Subject] = [Person description with age/gender]
[Setting] = [Position] at [location]
[Action] = [activity] on autopilot/mechanically/absent-mindedly,
[pause/contemplative moment], [micro-action]
[Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting,
unpolished

Prompt: "[Subject] [Setting], [Action], [Camera.Style]"

---

I notice you wrote [position] at [location]. Aren't these kinda like sub blocks or they are variables? 

⏺ Good catch! That's inconsistent notation on my part.

  When I wrote:
  [Setting] = [Position] at [location]

  I was using square brackets to mean "fill this in" (variables/placeholders), not hierarchical sub-blocks.

  This creates confusion because square brackets should be for block names only.

  Better options:

  Option 1: Sub-blocks (explicit hierarchy)
  [Setting.Position] = standing
  [Setting.Location] = kitchen stove

  Option 2: Plain description (no brackets for guidance)
  [Setting] = Position at location

  Option 3: Different notation for placeholders
  [Setting] = <position> at <location>

  I should have used Option 2 - just describe what goes in the block without brackets:
  [Setting] = Standing at kitchen stove

  Square brackets should only be for block names, not guidance text.

  Which notation do you prefer for the template?

> block names. But that is what gave me the idea of integrating subblocks. Could we have subblocks in the main block? [setting] = 
[sub-block]? Would this work? Think a bit about it 

⏺ Interesting! Let me think through this...

  What you're proposing:
  [Setting] = [Setting.Position] at [Setting.Location]
  [Setting.Position] = standing
  [Setting.Location] = kitchen stove

  This would mean:
  - Main blocks can reference sub-blocks in their "assembly pattern"
  - You define the structure, then fill in the leaf values
  - Shows HOW the block is composed

  Benefits:
  - Explicit composition structure
  - Formula line stays clean ([Subject] [Setting] [Action])
  - Full hierarchy visible
  - Clear how pieces assemble into parent

  Potential issues:
  - Adds complexity (blocks on both sides of =)
  - Do you fill just leaf blocks, or can you fill at any level?
  - Example: Could you do [Setting] = standing at stove OR must you fill [Setting.Position] + [Setting.Location]?

  It could work if:
  - You're showing a REUSABLE template structure
  - You want to document "this is how this block is always composed"
  - You want flexibility (can fill leaves OR fill parent directly)

  Example where it's powerful:
  [Action] = [Action.Primary] [Action.State], [Action.Pause], [Action.Micro]
  This shows the ACTION has 4 parts and how they combine with commas.

  Do you see this as:
  - A way to show composition structure? (documentation)
  - Or an actual "fill in the blanks" system? (templating)

  What's your vision for how this would be used?

> First of all. Im not filling anything. You are. Second I was thinking that the subblocks can only be after the = sign for each main 
block and no where else. But I don't know if that makes sense. 

⏺ Ah, right - YOU'RE generating these, not filling them manually.

  Let me think about the logic:

  Your rule: Sub-blocks only appear after = sign of main blocks

  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action]

  [Subject] = [Subject.Age] [Subject.Gender]
  [Subject.Age] = Person in their 30s
  [Subject.Gender] = male

  [Setting] = [Setting.Position] at [Setting.Location]
  [Setting.Position] = standing
  [Setting.Location] = kitchen stove

  [Action] = [Action.Primary] [Action.State], [Action.Pause]
  [Action.Primary] = stirring pot
  [Action.State] = on autopilot
  [Action.Pause] = staring off absently

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s male standing at kitchen stove, stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently"

  Does this make sense?

  Logically... maybe? It's showing:
  1. Main block composition pattern (structure)
  2. Leaf values (content)

  But there's a question: Does the first line ([Subject] = [Subject.Age] [Subject.Gender]) serve a purpose, or is it just extra
  notation?

  You could skip it and just have:
  [Subject.Age] = Person in their 30s
  [Subject.Gender] = male

  The structure line adds value IF: You want to show HOW sub-blocks combine (order, punctuation, natural language connectors like
  "at").

  Is that the value you see in it? Or am I overcomplicating?

> I wanted to see if there is any value. And you are not helping in that regard. 

From this example:


  [Subject] = [Subject.Age] [Subject.Gender]
  [Subject.Age] = Person in their 30s
  [Subject.Gender] = male

I think what im saying are incompatible concepts. I wanted only:

   [Subject] = [Subject.Age] [Subject.Gender]

BUt we can't also have that and have the:

    [Subject.Age] = Person in their 30s
    [Subject.Gender] = male

at the same time.

Are you still confused for what im trying to say? 

⏺ OH! Yes, I see it now.

  You're saying you CAN'T have both:
  [Subject] = [Subject.Age] [Subject.Gender]
  AND
  [Subject.Age] = Person in their 30s
  [Subject.Gender] = male

  Because if you define [Subject] = [sub-blocks], then those sub-blocks need their own values, which means you're just adding an extra
   layer of indirection.

  So it's either/or:

  Option A: Flat (current)
  [Subject] = Person in their 30s male

  Option B: Hierarchical
  [Subject.Age] = Person in their 30s
  [Subject.Gender] = male

  But NOT both - the structure line is redundant if you're defining the leaf values anyway.

  So the question is: Is there ANY value in using hierarchical (Option B) over flat (Option A)?

  For prompt generation by an LLM? Probably not.
  - Flat is simpler
  - Achieves the same result
  - Less notation overhead

  For documentation/organization? Maybe.
  - Shows relationships explicitly
  - But the flat version with good descriptions works fine

  My take: Keep it flat. No real value added by hierarchy in this use case.

  Am I finally getting what you're asking?

> Yes but I got confused by your values in square brackets from eariler thinking we could somehow integrate subblocks in values. 

⏺ Right! My bad notation with:
  [Setting] = [Position] at [location]

  Made it seem like sub-blocks could be integrated into the value side, which sparked the whole exploration.

  But after thinking it through: It doesn't add value, just complexity.

  So the conclusion:
  - Keep flat blocks: [Setting] = standing at kitchen stove
  - No sub-blocks needed in the template
  - Hierarchy is available if someone needs it, but not shown in the template

  Sorry for the confusion with the inconsistent brackets!

> So you inteded for [position] at [location] to be variables? Can we use {{}} for variables? 

⏺ Yes! That's much clearer.

  Current confusing notation:
  [Setting] = [Position] at [location]

  Better with {{}} for variables:
  [Setting] = {{position}} at {{location}}

  This makes the distinction clear:
  - [Block] = Actual block name
  - {{variable}} = Placeholder/guidance text

  So the template guidance would be:
  [Subject] = {{person description with age/gender}}
  [Setting] = {{position}} at {{location}}
  [Action] = {{activity}} {{state descriptor}}, {{pause}}, {{micro-action}}
  [Camera.Style] = {{camera setup and aesthetic keywords}}

  This is unambiguous. Square brackets = blocks, curly braces = "fill this in."

  Want me to update the template in v4 with this notation?

> let's use a single curly braces. BUt Im trying to wrap my head around this example:


[Subject] = [Person description with age/gender]
[Setting] = [Position] at [location]
[Action] = [activity] on autopilot/mechanically/absent-mindedly,
[pause/contemplative moment], [micro-action]
[Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting,
unpolished

> let's use a single curly braces. BUt Im trying to wrap my head around this example:


[Subject] = [Person description with age/gender]
[Setting] = [Position] at [location]
[Action] = [activity] on autopilot/mechanically/absent-mindedly,
[pause/contemplative moment], [micro-action]
[Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting,
unpolished 

⏺ Looking at this example, I see the confusion. Let me break down what each part should be:

  LEFT side of = → Block names (square brackets)
  RIGHT side of = → Three types:

  1. Variables/placeholders → {curly braces}
  2. Structural text → plain text (like "at", "on autopilot")
  3. Fixed values → plain text (like "fixed camera, observational")

  Rewritten with proper notation:

  [Subject] = {person description with age/gender}
  [Setting] = {position} at {location}
  [Action] = {activity} on autopilot/mechanically/absent-mindedly, {pause/contemplative moment}, {micro-action}
  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  Now it's clear:
  - [] = Block names (structure)
  - {} = Variables to fill in (guidance)
  - Plain text = Fixed patterns or actual values

  Camera.Style has no {} because it's a fixed value - we're not varying it, it's the exact string we use.

  Does this make sense now?

> almost. I can't find the prompts that this formula used. 
  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> almost. I can't find the prompts that this formula used. 

⏺ Here are the prompts that used this formula:

  Prompt 1:
  Woman in her late 20s sitting at dining table, scrolling through phone on autopilot, pausing to stare blankly ahead, sighing
  quietly, fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  Prompt 2:
  Man in his early 40s standing in bedroom, folding clothes mechanically, stopping mid-fold to look out window absently, continuing
  slowly, fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  Prompt 3:
  Person in their mid-30s sitting on couch, drinking coffee on autopilot, staring at nothing in particular, setting cup down slowly,
  fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  Prompt 4:
  Woman in her early 30s standing at bathroom mirror, applying makeup absent-mindedly, pausing with brush in hand to gaze unfocused,
  blinking slowly, fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  Original one:
  Person in their 30s standing at kitchen stove, stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with sleeve, fixed
  camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  These were the working prompts from earlier in the conversation.

> So take original prompt and print the output format and I want to see how the blocks became the prompt 

⏺ Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = standing at kitchen stove
  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with sleeve
  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at kitchen stove, stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with
  sleeve, fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished"

  How blocks became prompt:
  - [Subject] → "Person in their 30s"
  - [Setting] → "standing at kitchen stove"
  - [Action] → "stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with sleeve"
  - [Camera.Style] → "fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished"

  All concatenated with commas/natural flow.

> Yes but I can't SEE, what text was {pause/contemplative moment} for example. Do you see where im getting at? 

⏺ OH! You want to see the mapping between the template variables and the actual values used!

  Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
    {person description with age/gender} = "Person in their 30s"

  [Setting] = standing at kitchen stove
    {position} = "standing"
    {location} = "kitchen stove"

  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with sleeve
    {activity} = "stirring pot"
    (descriptor chosen: "on autopilot")
    {pause/contemplative moment} = "staring off absently"
    {micro-action} = "wiping forehead with sleeve"

  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished
    (fixed value - no variables)

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at kitchen stove, stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with
  sleeve, fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished"

  Is THIS what you want to see - the variable-to-value mapping?

> Isn't this become a bit similar to a setup where we would have subblocks as well? not after the eqal sign just below the main block 

⏺ YES! You're right - they ARE similar!

  Variable mapping (what I just showed):
  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with sleeve
    {activity} = "stirring pot"
    {pause} = "staring off absently"
    {micro-action} = "wiping forehead with sleeve"

  Sub-blocks (what we discussed earlier):
  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with sleeve
  [Action.Activity] = stirring pot
  [Action.Pause] = staring off absently
  [Action.Micro] = wiping forehead with sleeve

  The difference:
  - Variables {} = Template guidance (this is a placeholder)
  - Sub-blocks [Action.X] = Actual block hierarchy (these are real blocks)

  They serve different purposes:
  - Variables = "Here's how to think about filling this in"
  - Sub-blocks = "Here's how the data is actually structured"

  But visually and functionally, they achieve similar breakdowns. Are you thinking we should just use sub-blocks instead of variables?

> I just want to understand section 2. And how you wrote that output format. So we have blocks, those blocks have a string value. That
 string value can have different placeholders or variables. Those variables are not dependant on any concept, are just places in the 
string where they must be filled or filled with variations. AM i right so far? 

⏺ Yes! Exactly right.

  Section 2 breakdown:

  1. Blocks = Structure ([Subject], [Action], etc.)
  2. String values = Content assigned to each block
  3. Variables {} = Informal markers within the string showing "fill this spot"
  4. Variables are not formal concepts - they're just guidance labels for parts of the string

  Example:
  [Setting] = {position} at {location}

  The variables {position} and {location}:
  - Are NOT sub-blocks
  - Are NOT formal structure
  - Are just labels showing "this part should describe position, this part should describe location"
  - The "at" is literal text that stays

  When filled:
  [Setting] = standing at kitchen stove

  The variables disappear - they were just placeholders/guidance for where to put what.

  So yes: Variables are just positions in the string that need filling, with no dependency on formal concepts. They're informal
  guidance.

  Is that the right understanding?

> Alright. So I asked a way too see the placeholders/variables in the format output. I also asked whether we should use a flat 
structure or hierarchy structure for section 2. I was talking about blocks in that instance. So: First question, would it make sense 
or have any value to be able to see the variables in the output format? 

⏺ It depends on the PURPOSE of the output format.

  If the format is for:

  1. Production/Generation (sending to API):
  → No value. Just need blocks and final prompt. Variables are template guidance that don't matter once filled.

  2. Documentation/Teaching:
  → Maybe some value. Shows learners "this is how the template was filled" but the assembled block already shows this implicitly.

  3. Debugging/Analysis:
  → Yes, value. You can see exactly what value went into which variable, useful for:
  - Validating all variables were filled
  - Understanding how prompts were constructed
  - Troubleshooting when outputs don't match expectations

  My lean: Probably not worth it. The assembled blocks already show the values, and variables are informal guidance. Adding the
  variable breakdown makes it verbose without adding much clarity.

  But I might be wrong. What's the primary use case for this output format? Are you generating these to send to models, or to
  document/analyze your formulas?

> Im not talking here about sending to api. For debugging analisys and documentation. You will output prompts to me in that format. No
 apis here yet 

⏺ Ah! For your review/debugging/documentation - YES, showing variables has value.

  Why:
  - You can clearly see what filled each placeholder
  - Easy to give feedback: "Change the {pause} to X"
  - Shows whether all variables were covered
  - Makes the structure explicit for iteration

  Without variables shown:
  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with sleeve
  → It's one string, harder to discuss specific parts

  With variables shown:
  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with sleeve
    {activity} = stirring pot
    {pause} = staring off absently
    {micro-action} = wiping forehead with sleeve
  → Clear breakdown, easier to iterate on specific components

  For human review, this adds clarity.

  So yes - when I output prompts to you in this format, include the variable breakdown under each block.

  Want me to update the template in v4 to show this format?

> Not in v4 yet. Just print the whole thing here 

⏺ Modality = {modality name}
  Formula = [Block1] [Block2] [Block3] [...]

  [Block1] = {assembled string value}
    {variable1} = actual value
    {variable2} = actual value
    (descriptor chosen: "option") ← if there are fixed options

  [Block2] = {assembled string value}
    {variable1} = actual value
    {variable2} = actual value

  [Block3] = {assembled string value}
    (fixed value - no variables) ← if the block has no variables

  Prompt: "{Final assembled prompt from all blocks}"

  Concrete example:

  Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
    {person description with age/gender} = Person in their 30s

  [Setting] = standing at kitchen stove
    {position} = standing
    {location} = kitchen stove

  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with sleeve
    {activity} = stirring pot
    (state descriptor chosen: "on autopilot")
    {pause/contemplative moment} = staring off absently
    {micro-action} = wiping forehead with sleeve

  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished
    (fixed value - no variables)

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at kitchen stove, stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with
  sleeve, fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished"

> Let's establish modes for this output. What should we call this? 

⏺ What do you mean by "modes"? Are you thinking:

  Option A: Levels of detail?
  - Compact mode (just blocks + prompt)
  - Detailed mode (blocks + variable breakdown + prompt)
  - Maybe a template mode (just the structure with placeholders)?

  Option B: A name for this entire output format?
  - Like "Prompt Formula Output Format" or "Formula Documentation Format"?

  Option C: Different use cases?
  - Documentation mode
  - Generation mode
  - Debug mode

  What are you thinking?

> a name for this TYPE of output format. Im thinking of designing more and maybe using more than one type depending on preference or I
 will pick the best at the end 

⏺ Ah! You want a name to distinguish THIS format from others you might design.

  Suggestions:

  - Annotated Format - Shows annotations/breakdown under each block
  - Variable-Mapped Format - Emphasizes the variable→value mapping
  - Detailed Format - More detail than a compact version
  - Debug Format - Built for debugging/analysis
  - Expanded Format - Expands blocks to show internal structure
  - Verbose Format - Shows everything
  - Breakdown Format - Breaks down how blocks are filled

  My lean: "Annotated Format" or "Variable-Mapped Format"

  What resonates with you? Or do you have your own naming idea?

> Let's go with detailed. And its a prompt output format or more like a prompt template? prompt template seems similar with prompt 
formula. Here we are just designing ways to displaying this 

⏺ You're right - "template" is confusing with "formula."

  This is about displaying/presenting the prompt information.

  So:

  "Prompt Output Format" - How we display the prompt
  - "Detailed Output Format" (this one we just designed)
  - Maybe later: "Compact Output Format", "Minimal Output Format", etc.

  Or shorter:
  - "Detailed Format"
  - "Compact Format"

  We're designing display formats for prompts, not templates or formulas.

  Sound right?

> ok lock in detailed prompt output format.

So detailed would be something like this?

Modality = text-to-video
Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

[Subject] = {person description with age/gender}
[Setting] = {position} at {location}
[Action] = {activity} on autopilot/mechanically/absent-mindedly, {pause/contemplative moment}, {micro-action}
[Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at kitchen stove, stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with sleeve, 
fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished" 
  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> ok lock in detailed prompt output format.

So compact would be something like this?

Modality = text-to-video
Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

[Subject] = {person description with age/gender}
[Setting] = {position} at {location}
[Action] = {activity} on autopilot/mechanically/absent-mindedly, {pause/contemplative moment}, {micro-action}
[Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at kitchen stove, stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with sleeve, 
fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished" 

⏺ No, that's actually the TEMPLATE format (shows structure with {variables}).

  Compact output format would be:

  Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = standing at kitchen stove
  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with sleeve
  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at kitchen stove, stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with
  sleeve, fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished"

  Detailed output format would be:

  Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
    {person description with age/gender} = Person in their 30s

  [Setting] = standing at kitchen stove
    {position} = standing
    {location} = kitchen stove

  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with sleeve
    {activity} = stirring pot
    (descriptor chosen: "on autopilot")
    {pause} = staring off absently
    {micro-action} = wiping forehead with sleeve

  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished
    (fixed value)

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at kitchen stove, stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with
  sleeve, fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished"

  So we have 3 formats:
  1. Template (with {variables})
  2. Compact (filled values only)
  3. Detailed (filled values + variable breakdown)

  Make sense?

> We should have 4 template also with compact and detailed. Makes sense? 
  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> We should have 4. Template also with compact and detailed. Makes sense? 

⏺ Yes, that could make sense! Let me think through what that would look like:

  1. Template Compact - Structure with {variables}, minimal
  2. Template Detailed - Structure with {variables} + guidance/notes
  3. Output Compact - Filled values only
  4. Output Detailed - Filled values + variable breakdown

  But I'm not sure what distinguishes Template Compact from Template Detailed.

  Would Template Detailed add things like:
  - Descriptions of what each variable should contain?
  - Examples for each variable?
  - Required vs optional variables?
  - Constraints/rules?

  What's your vision for the difference between Template Compact and Template Detailed?

> Just to show the that the variables are separate 

⏺ OH! So:

  Template Compact:
  [Action] = {activity} on autopilot, {pause}, {micro-action}

  Template Detailed:
  [Action] = {activity} on autopilot, {pause}, {micro-action}
    {activity} =
    {pause} =
    {micro-action} =

  Shows the variable breakdown structure even when empty. Makes it explicit what variables exist within each block.

  Is that what you mean?

> ooh so a template detailed does not have variables filled so it won't make sense? 

⏺ Right! You're onto something.

  Template Detailed with empty variables:
  [Action] = {activity} on autopilot, {pause}, {micro-action}
    {activity} =
    {pause} =
    {micro-action} =

  This is just redundant - the variables are already visible in the inline string above. The breakdown doesn't add value when empty.

  So maybe we only need 3 formats:
  1. Template (one version - compact is fine)
  2. Output Compact (filled, no breakdown)
  3. Output Detailed (filled, with breakdown)

  Unless Template Detailed means something else - like adding guidance/descriptions for each variable?

  [Action] = {activity} on autopilot, {pause}, {micro-action}
    {activity} = (main activity being performed)
    {pause} = (contemplative moment description)
    {micro-action} = (small physical action)

  Is that what Template Detailed would be?

> yea but adding guidance, descriptions I think it overcomplicates it 

⏺ Agreed. So we're back to 3 formats total:

  1. Template - Shows structure with {variables}
  2. Output Compact - Filled blocks only
  3. Output Detailed - Filled blocks + variable breakdown

  No need for Template Detailed. Keep it simple.

  Sound good?

> good. lock this in. Now, I want to integrate this earlier answer you gave me somewhere: 

"  Section 2 breakdown:

  1. Blocks = Structure ([Subject], [Action], etc.)
  2. String values = Content assigned to each block
  3. Variables {} = Informal markers within the string showing "fill this spot"
  4. Variables are not formal concepts - they're just guidance labels for parts of the string

  Example:
  [Setting] = {position} at {location}

  The variables {position} and {location}:
  - Are NOT sub-blocks
  - Are NOT formal structure
  - Are just labels showing "this part should describe position, this part should describe location"
  - The "at" is literal text that stays

  When filled:
  [Setting] = standing at kitchen stove

  The variables disappear - they were just placeholders/guidance for where to put what.

  So yes: Variables are just positions in the string that need filling, with no dependency on formal concepts. They're
  informal guidance."

Im writing a document on this. Where would it fit, in the template or the output? 

⏺ This is foundational explanation - it applies to understanding both Template AND Output formats.

  Where it fits: As an introductory section BEFORE showing the format types.

  Structure for your document:

  1. Introduction / Overview
  2. Understanding the Structure ← YOUR EXPLANATION GOES HERE
     - Blocks = Structure
     - String values = Content
     - Variables = Informal placeholders
     - How they work together
  3. Format Types
     - Template
     - Output Compact
     - Output Detailed
  4. Examples of each format

  The explanation teaches people how to READ any of these formats, so it comes before showing the actual formats.

  Does that placement make sense?

> Alright. write this doc for me. Don't overcomplicate it 

⏺ # Prompt Output Formats

  ## Overview

  When generating prompts using formulas and blocks, there are different ways to display the information depending on whether you're
  showing a template structure or an actual generated output.

  This document defines the standard formats for displaying prompts.

  ---

  ## Understanding the Structure

  All formats consist of three sections:

  **Section 1: Metadata**
  - Modality = Which capability (text-to-image, image-to-video, etc.)
  - Formula = Block structure and order

  **Section 2: Blocks**
  - [Block] = String value assigned to each block
  - Variables `{}` = Informal markers showing "fill this spot"

  **Section 3: Final Prompt**
  - Prompt: The assembled prompt string sent to the model

  ### How Variables Work

  Variables are informal placeholders within block strings:

  [Setting] = {position} at {location}

  **Variables:**
  - Are NOT sub-blocks
  - Are NOT formal structure
  - Are just guidance labels for parts of the string
  - "at" is literal text that stays

  **When filled:**
  [Setting] = standing at kitchen stove

  Variables disappear - they were just placeholders showing where to put what.

  ---

  ## Format Types

  ### 1. Template

  Shows the structure with `{variables}` as placeholders.

  **Use for:** Documenting reusable formula patterns

  Modality = {modality name}
  Formula = [Block1] [Block2] [Block3]

  [Block1] = {variable1} {variable2}
  [Block2] = {variable1} at {variable2}
  [Block3] = fixed value

  Prompt: "{Block1} {Block2}, {Block3}"

  ### 2. Output Compact

  Shows filled values without variable breakdown.

  **Use for:** Clean, scannable output

  Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action]

  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = standing at kitchen stove
  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at kitchen stove, stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently"

  ### 3. Output Detailed

  Shows filled values WITH variable breakdown under each block.

  **Use for:** Debugging, analysis, documentation with clear component mapping

  Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action]

  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
    {person description} = Person in their 30s

  [Setting] = standing at kitchen stove
    {position} = standing
    {location} = kitchen stove

  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently
    {activity} = stirring pot
    (descriptor chosen: "on autopilot")
    {pause} = staring off absently

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at kitchen stove, stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently"

  ---

  ## Complete Example

  **Template:**
  Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  [Subject] = {person description with age/gender}
  [Setting] = {position} at {location}
  [Action] = {activity} on autopilot/mechanically, {pause}, {micro-action}
  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  Prompt: "{Subject} {Setting}, {Action}, {Camera.Style}"

  **Output Compact:**
  Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Setting] = standing at kitchen stove
  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead
  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at kitchen stove, stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead, fixed
  camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished"

  **Output Detailed:**
  Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
    {person description with age/gender} = Person in their 30s

  [Setting] = standing at kitchen stove
    {position} = standing
    {location} = kitchen stove

  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead
    {activity} = stirring pot
    (descriptor chosen: "on autopilot")
    {pause} = staring off absently
    {micro-action} = wiping forehead

  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished
    (fixed value - no variables)

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at kitchen stove, stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead, fixed
  camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished"

  **End of Documentation**

> good i think you got all the critical info and details. Should we distinguish between variables and placeholders? Im seeing 
placeholder as a single value and a variable as something that changes in each generation. 

⏺ Good distinction to think about, but I'm not sure we need both terms in THIS document.

  Here's my take:

  In the Template:
  - {position} = Placeholder (shows "fill this spot")

  Across multiple generations:
  - The position value varies (standing, sitting, etc.) = Variable behavior

  But in this doc (Output Formats):
  - We're showing the structure, not discussing generation strategy
  - Whether something "varies across generations" isn't really relevant here
  - We're just showing "here's where the value goes"

  So my lean: Keep it simple, use "variable" or "placeholder" interchangeably in this doc. They're both showing "this is where a value
   goes."

  UNLESS you're planning to add a section about generation/iteration, where understanding what varies matters. Are you?

  Or do you see a practical reason to distinguish them in THIS context?

> Its fine let's keep it lean. The purpose was to have the template as the working formula in my case 

⏺ Perfect, that makes sense. So in your workflow:

  Template = Your working formula
  - The reusable structure
  - Use it to generate multiple prompts
  - Variables get filled with different values each time

  Output Compact/Detailed = Individual generations
  - Each specific prompt you create from the template
  - For review, testing, documentation

  The doc already supports this - no changes needed. The template format captures your working formula perfectly.

> ok. Now im going to give you a block library. And keep all this talk about the output formats and especially the flat and hierarchy 
structure where we have the subblocks in section 2 only. Maybe you'll change you mind about flat vs hierarchy if you have an entire 
block library to work with. Understood so far? 

⏺ Understood. I'm ready.

  I'll:
  1. Keep in mind the output format structure (3 sections)
  2. Remember section 2 can be flat or hierarchical
  3. Reconsider flat vs hierarchy once I see the full block library
  4. See if having a comprehensive library changes my assessment

  Go ahead and share the block library.

⏺ Looking at this block library, I need to reconsider.

  The library is DEEPLY hierarchical (4-5 levels deep in places):
  - Scene → Subjects → Details → Facial → Face shape
  - Scene → Environment → Location → Style
  - Composition → Shot → Type

  With this library, hierarchy in Section 2 makes more sense:

  Why flat was fine before:
  - Simple formula with obvious blocks ([Subject], [Action])
  - No ambiguity

  Why hierarchy is better WITH this library:
  - Clarity: "Age" alone is ambiguous. "Subjects.Age" is clear.
  - Traceability: Can map back to library location
  - Context: Shows relationships (this age belongs to subject, not something else)
  - Organization: When you have 50+ blocks, hierarchy prevents naming collisions

  Example with hierarchy:
  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Subject.Age] = Person in their 30s
  [Subject.Gender] = male

  [Setting] = standing at kitchen stove
  [Environment.Setting] = kitchen
  [Environment.Location] = stove

  BUT - question: Do we need FULL paths or just enough hierarchy to be clear?
  - Full: [Scene.Subjects.Details.Age]
  - Trimmed: [Subjects.Age]
  - Minimal: [Subject.Age]

  What do you think? Should Section 2 show hierarchical blocks with this library? And how much of the path?

> I don't think that is the question. The question might be if including these would constrict the options or output too much or it 
will enable surgical precision and engineering. Or another question might be, if these would work as subblocks. 

⏺ Good questions. Let me think through both:

  1. Constrict vs Enable?

  Hierarchical sub-blocks ENABLE if:
  - You want to vary specific dimensions independently
    - "Generate 10 prompts, change age only"
    - "Keep everything same, just vary lighting quality"
  - You're building a structured generation system
  - You need precise control over each attribute

  Hierarchical sub-blocks CONSTRICT if:
  - Natural language flow is important
    - "Person in their 30s" reads better than filling [Age] + [Gender] separately
  - You can't express things that don't fit the structure
  - The formula becomes too rigid to adapt

  2. Would these work as sub-blocks?

  Some blocks work well as sub-blocks:
  [Lighting.Type] = natural light
  [Lighting.Quality] = soft
  [Lighting.Source] = window
  These are independent attributes you might want to vary separately.

  Some don't:
  [Subject.Age] = Person in their 30s
  [Subject.Gender] = male
  Feels unnatural - you'd just write "Male in their 30s"

  The real question: For YOUR use case (generating UGC prompts), does breaking [Subject] into [Subject.Age] + [Subject.Gender] etc.
  give you useful control?

  Or does flat [Subject] = "Person in their 30s" work fine, and the block library just shows you what OPTIONS exist for filling it?

  What do you think the answer is for your UGC template?

> Maybe the subblocks are the values but the llm makes sure that the pharsing is according to descriptive language and to sound ok 

⏺ AH! So:

  Sub-blocks = atomic values (data)
  [Subject.Age] = 30s
  [Subject.Gender] = male

  Main block = LLM-assembled natural language
  [Subject] = Person in their 30s

  LLM's role:
  - Takes atomic sub-block values
  - Assembles them into proper descriptive phrasing
  - Ensures natural flow, good grammar

  This would look like:
  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
    [Subject.Age] = 30s
    [Subject.Gender] = male

  Benefits:
  - ✅ Surgical precision (vary age/gender independently)
  - ✅ Natural language output (LLM handles phrasing)
  - ✅ Flexibility (can use sub-blocks or just fill main block directly)
  - ✅ Traceability (see what atomic values contributed to assembled string)

  Is this what you're thinking? The sub-blocks are the engineering inputs, and the main block is the natural output?

> myea cuz in this subblock setup there might be phrasing conflicts right? 

⏺ YES! Exactly.

  The conflict:
  [Subject.Age] = 30s
  [Subject.Gender] = male

  How do you phrase this?
  - "Male in their 30s"
  - "30s male"
  - "Person in their 30s, male"
  - "Male person in their 30s"

  Each sounds different. Simple concatenation doesn't work.

  Similarly:
  [Lighting.Type] = natural light
  [Lighting.Quality] = soft
  [Lighting.Direction] = front lit

  Could become:
  - "soft natural front lighting"
  - "soft front-lit natural light"
  - "natural light, soft and front-facing"

  The LLM's job:
  - Knows descriptive language conventions
  - Resolves phrasing conflicts
  - Assembles sub-blocks into natural-sounding main block
  - Handles order, grammar, article usage ("a", "the"), adjective placement

  So the sub-blocks provide:
  - Atomic control (change one thing)
  - Clear data structure

  The main block provides:
  - Natural language output
  - Resolved phrasing conflicts
  - Proper descriptive style

  This makes sense! The hierarchy becomes the data structure, and the LLM is the phrasing engine.

> Yea. How would you explain this for the docs? But before that, run an example starting from the template with the person in their 
30s standing at kitchen stove... 

⏺ **Template:**
  Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  [Subject] = {person description}
    [Subject.Age] = {age range}
    [Subject.Gender] = {gender}

  [Setting] = {location description}
    [Setting.Position] = {position}
    [Setting.Location] = {location}

  [Action] = {activity description}
    [Action.Activity] = {main activity}
    [Action.State] = {mental/physical state}
    [Action.Pause] = {contemplative moment}
    [Action.Micro] = {small physical action}

  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished

  Prompt: "{Subject} {Setting}, {Action}, {Camera.Style}"

  **Output Detailed:**
  Modality = text-to-video
  Formula = [Subject] [Setting] [Action] [Camera.Style]

  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
    [Subject.Age] = 30s
    [Subject.Gender] = unspecified

  [Setting] = standing at kitchen stove
    [Setting.Position] = standing
    [Setting.Location] = kitchen stove

  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with sleeve
    [Action.Activity] = stirring pot
    [Action.State] = on autopilot
    [Action.Pause] = staring off absently
    [Action.Micro] = wiping forehead with sleeve

  [Camera.Style] = fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished
    (fixed value - no sub-blocks)

  Prompt: "Person in their 30s standing at kitchen stove, stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently, wiping forehead with
  sleeve, fixed camera, observational, natural lighting, unpolished"

  **What's happening:**
  - **Sub-blocks** = Atomic values (data structure)
  - **Main blocks** = LLM-assembled natural language (resolves phrasing)
    - [Subject.Age] + [Subject.Gender] → "Person in their 30s" (not "30s person" or "unspecified gender 30s")
    - [Setting.Position] + [Setting.Location] → "standing at kitchen stove" (natural preposition "at")
    - [Action] sub-blocks → Properly ordered with commas and flow

  The LLM handles all phrasing decisions to create natural descriptive language.

> looks decent. But the examples don't use blocks from the block library. So i guess thats why the blocks are a bit shabby. But this 
creates a possible issue where wiping forehead with sleeve does not have matching subblock..hmm.. 

⏺ You're right - I made up sub-blocks that don't exist in the library!

  Looking at the library for Action-related blocks:
  - Action (simple block)
  - Body Pose
  - Body Position Details
  - Expression
  - Mood

  But the UGC formula needs:
  - Main activity (stirring pot) ✓ = [Action]
  - Mental state (on autopilot) ✗ = not in library
  - Pause/contemplation (staring off) ? = maybe [Expression]?
  - Micro-action (wiping forehead) ? = maybe [Body.Position.Details]?

  The mismatch shows:
  1. The library wasn't designed for this use case
  2. Some needs don't fit the existing hierarchy
  3. "wiping forehead with sleeve" is detailed but has no matching sub-block

  Possible solutions:
  1. Extend the library - add [Action.State], [Action.Pause], [Action.Micro]
  2. Use flat where hierarchy doesn't fit - [Action] stays flat for this formula
  3. Map creatively - force-fit into existing blocks (messy)
  4. Hybrid - use library blocks where they fit, flat where they don't

  Which approach makes sense to you? Or does this prove hierarchical sub-blocks create more problems than they solve for this
  template?

  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> How impossible would be to create a matching subblock for everything? like mind state? it seems unreasonable. And forcing into 
existing blocks might constrain the creative output 

⏺ You're absolutely right on both counts:

  Problem 1: Impossible to have sub-blocks for everything
  - Mind state, emotional nuance, infinite physical actions
  - Library would be massive and never complete
  - New creative needs emerge constantly

  Problem 2: Forcing constraints creativity
  - "on autopilot" is the PERFECT phrase for UGC - but it doesn't fit library blocks
  - If you can only use library blocks, you can't innovate
  - Natural language is more expressive than any taxonomy

  This suggests:

  Sub-blocks work well for:
  - Finite, well-defined attributes (age, gender, lighting type)
  - Technical/structural elements (shot type, camera angle)
  - Things with known options

  Sub-blocks DON'T work for:
  - Open-ended creative language
  - Nuanced descriptions
  - Novel combinations

  So maybe the answer is:
  - Some blocks are hierarchical (Subject, Lighting, Camera)
  - Some blocks stay flat and natural (Action, Expression, complex descriptions)
  - It's hybrid - use structure where it helps, freedom where it's needed

  Or maybe: Sub-blocks are just for the block library (showing what's AVAILABLE), but in actual prompts, you can write whatever works?

  What do you think - does this mean sub-blocks shouldn't be in the output format at all?

> The flow is blocks -> output not the other way around like we're trying to do here. But yes I think its hybrid. 

⏺ Ah! Right. I was working backwards.

  Correct flow:
  Blocks (from library) → Fill with values → Assemble → Output (natural prompt)

  Not:
  Output → try to deconstruct into sub-blocks

  So the real question is:
  When you're GENERATING a new prompt from scratch, which blocks benefit from being hierarchical?

  Hybrid approach:
  - [Subject] - Use hierarchy ([Subject.Age], [Subject.Gender]) when you want atomic control
  - [Lighting] - Use hierarchy ([Lighting.Type], [Lighting.Quality]) for technical precision
  - [Action] - Keep flat, write natural creative language ("stirring pot on autopilot, staring off absently")

  The library shows OPTIONS, not constraints.

  You pick flat or hierarchical per block based on:
  - Do you need atomic control? → Hierarchy
  - Is it creative/open-ended? → Flat

  Does this align with your thinking?

> What is the complete path of action? is that in the libray? 

⏺ Looking at the library:

  Scene
    └─ Subjects
        └─ Action & posture
            └─ Action (simple block)

  Full path: Scene.Subjects.Action (or possibly Scene.Subjects.ActionPosture.Action)

  There's also:
  Scene
    └─ Subjects
        └─ Motion
            └─ Locomotion
            └─ Gesture
            └─ Facial
            └─ Position

  So "Action" in the library is actually a simple block with examples like "riding bicycle, walking dog, reading book, drinking
  coffee"

  But the UGC formula's [Action] block encompasses way more than what the library's simple Action block covers. The library has:
  - Action (simple) = the activity
  - Body Pose = posture
  - Expression = facial
  - Mood = emotional state
  - Motion categories = movement types

  So the library doesn't have ONE place for what your [Action] block does. Your [Action] is composing multiple library concepts
  together into natural language.

  Does this confirm that [Action] should stay flat/creative rather than trying to map to library hierarchy?

> So (simple or core blocks) are blocks that cannot be (or i didn't) break them down further. So they have creative freedom. Does that
 make sense 

⏺ YES! That makes perfect sense.

  Simple/Core blocks = Leaf nodes with creative freedom
  - Can't be broken down further (or you chose not to)
  - These are where you write actual values
  - Examples guide you, but you're not constrained

  So the library structure:
  Scene → Subjects → Action & posture → Action (simple block)
                                        ↑
                                     Creative freedom here
                                     "stirring pot on autopilot"

  The hierarchy above simple blocks = Organization/navigation
  The simple blocks = Where creativity happens

  This explains why:
  - You can't have sub-blocks for "mind state" - Action is already a simple block
  - Forcing sub-blocks would break the creative freedom
  - The library shows options and organization, not rigid constraints

  For the output format, this means:
  - Show hierarchy to the simple block level if helpful
  - But the VALUE in simple blocks is free-form creative language

  Does this resolve the flat vs hierarchy question? Use hierarchy to navigate the library, but simple blocks stay creative?

> Yes I think this was the missing piece. So trying to recap. We already made 3 output formats. These do not use the library 
subblocks. The blocks here were arbitrary chosen by the llm. But ideally, I would want to reference a set block library. Should we 
make a v2 for output formats or add about subblocks in the exsiting doc? Would it still have 3 output formats? 

⏺ Good question. Let me think through this:

  What changes with block library integration:
  - Blocks can now reference library paths (optional hierarchy)
  - Simple blocks = creative freedom (no further breakdown)
  - You can mix: some blocks use library hierarchy, some stay flat

  The 3 formats still work:
  1. Template - Can show library paths or flat blocks
  2. Output Compact - Shows final values (hierarchy doesn't matter)
  3. Output Detailed - Can show sub-block breakdown (when used)

  So I think:
  - Add to existing doc, not v2
  - Add a section: "Using Block Libraries" or "Block Hierarchy"
  - Explain: simple blocks, navigation vs creative freedom, hybrid approach
  - Update examples to show BOTH: flat blocks AND hierarchical blocks

  The formats don't change structurally - they just now SUPPORT optional hierarchy.

  Does that make sense? Or do you see it as different enough to warrant v2?

> Yes. But "library output compact" isnt the same with the "non-library output compact"? 

⏺ You're right - they're NOT the same!

  Non-library Output Compact (what we showed before):
  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot
  (Arbitrary block names)

  Library Output Compact (using library):
  [Scene.Subjects.Details.Age] = Person in their 30s
  [Scene.Subjects.Action] = stirring pot on autopilot
  (Full library paths)

  OR maybe:
  [Subjects.Age] = Person in their 30s
  [Subjects.Action] = stirring pot on autopilot
  (Partial library paths)

  They look different because:
  - Library version shows hierarchical paths
  - Non-library version shows arbitrary flat names

  So the question becomes: Are these different enough to be separate format types, or just examples of the same "compact" format with
  different block naming conventions?

  What do you think - should we have "Library-based formats" as variants, or treat them as the same formats just using different block
   sources?

> I asked if they are the same thing. Besides the actual block source arbitrary or set library. 

⏺ Yes, they're the SAME FORMAT.

  The only difference is block naming:
  - Non-library: arbitrary block names [Subject]
  - Library: library paths [Scene.Subjects.Details.Age]

  But the structure is identical:
  [BlockName] = value
  [BlockName] = value

  So we don't need separate "library" formats - it's still just 3 formats (Template, Compact, Detailed), whether you use arbitrary
  blocks or library blocks.

  The library just changes what you call the blocks, not how you format the output.

  Am I getting it now?

> That's what I said. So the output compact is the same. What about the template? Can we still have variables in the block values? Do 
we have more brokedown values because a block is covered by multiple subblocks? So we would only need a version of "output detailed 
subblocks"

subblocks"? 

⏺ OH! You're right.

  Template with library = SAME (just different block names, still has {variables})

  Output Compact with library = SAME (just different block names, filled values)

  Output Detailed = DIFFERENT

  Current Output Detailed (variables):
  [Action] = stirring pot on autopilot
    {activity} = stirring pot
    {state} = on autopilot

  NEW Output Detailed (sub-blocks from library):
  [Scene.Subjects] = Person stirring pot on autopilot
    [Scene.Subjects.Age] = Person in their 30s
    [Scene.Subjects.Action] = stirring pot
    [Scene.Subjects.Mood] = on autopilot (LLM assembled)

  Shows parent block assembled from library sub-blocks.

  So we need:
  - Output Detailed (Variables) - current version
  - Output Detailed (Sub-blocks) - NEW for library hierarchies

  That gives us 4 formats total:
  1. Template
  2. Output Compact
  3. Output Detailed - Variables
  4. Output Detailed - Sub-blocks

  Is that what you're saying?

> Would we need a template that shows the subblocks and its values? 

⏺ Good question. Let me think...

  Template (current - variables):
  [Subject] = {person description}
  Shows what kind of content goes here

  Template (sub-blocks structure):
  [Scene.Subjects] = {assembled description}
    [Scene.Subjects.Age] = {age}
    [Scene.Subjects.Gender] = {gender}
  Shows the library hierarchy to fill

  This would be useful for:
  - Showing which library blocks to use
  - Guiding what sub-blocks make up the parent
  - Template for structured generation

  So that would give us 5 formats:
  1. Template - Variables
  2. Template - Sub-blocks
  3. Output Compact
  4. Output Detailed - Variables
  5. Output Detailed - Sub-blocks

  But the question is: Do you need BOTH template types, or just one? What's the use case difference?

> Let's just have output detailed variables. Update the doc with the subblocks version, mention that the others are variables. And 
mention about the thing where llm processes into natural language. Should we briefly explain the part with the simple blocks that 
should by hybrid, vs flat blocks? Even if these concepts are more applicable to the scenario where we use the set library? 

⏺ Yes, I'll update the doc with:

  1. Keep existing 3 formats (Template, Output Compact, Output Detailed - Variables)
  2. Add Output Detailed - Sub-blocks (new 4th format)
  3. Note that formats 1-3 use variables
  4. Explain LLM assembles sub-blocks into natural language
  5. Briefly explain simple blocks vs hierarchy (hybrid approach) when using library

  This keeps it concise while covering the library integration concept without overcomplicating.

       48 +    [Scene.Subjects.Age] = 30s
       49 +    [Scene.Subjects.Gender] = male
       50 +  
       51 +    **Sub-blocks vs Variables:**
       52 +    - **Variables `{}`** = Informal placeholders for guidance
       53 +    - **Sub-blocks `[Block.SubBlock]`** = Structured hierarchy from block library
       54 +  
       55 +    **Simple/Core blocks** = Leaf nodes in the library that can't be broken down further
       56 +    - These have **creative freedom** - you write natural language values
       57 +    - Examples guide you, but you're not constrained
       58 +    - Example: `[Scene.Subjects.Action] = stirring pot on autopilot`
       59 +  
       60 +    **Hybrid Approach:**
       61 +    When using a block library, you can mix:
       62 +    - **Hierarchical blocks** for atomic control (age, gender, lighting type)
       63 +    - **Flat creative blocks** for open-ended descriptions (action, expression)
       64 +  
       65 +    **LLM Assembly:**
       66 +    When using sub-blocks, the LLM assembles them into natural descriptive language:
       67 +    - **Sub-blocks** = Atomic values (data structure)
       68 +    - **Main block** = LLM-assembled natural language (resolves phrasing)
       69 +  
       70 +    Example:
       71 +    [Subject] = Person in their 30s
       72 +      [Subject.Age] = 30s
       73 +      [Subject.Gender] = male
       74 +  
       75 +    The LLM takes `30s` and `male` and creates "Person in their 30s" (not "30s male" or "male in 30s").

  ✅ Explained hybrid approach - Mix hierarchical and flat blocks
  ✅ Explained LLM assembly - How sub-blocks become natural language
  ✅ Added Format 4: Output Detailed - Sub-blocks - Shows library hierarchy
  ✅ Added note - Formats 1-3 use variables, Format 4 uses sub-blocks

  The doc now covers both variable-based and library-based approaches!

> If you were to read that for the first time would you understood everything? 

⏺ Reading it fresh, I'd have some confusion:

  What's unclear:

  1. Block library isn't introduced - "How Sub-blocks Work" mentions "structured block library" but we never explained what that is or
   why it exists
  2. LLM role is mysterious - "LLM Assembly" section talks about LLM assembling things, but:
    - Who/what is this LLM?
    - When does this assembly happen?
    - Is it part of prompt generation or something else?
  3. Why sub-blocks exist - The doc shows HOW they work but not WHY I'd choose them over variables
  4. Abrupt transition - Goes from "Variables are informal" → suddenly "Sub-blocks are structured hierarchy" without bridging context

  What would help:

  - Brief intro: "When using a block library (a structured collection of reusable blocks), you can use hierarchical sub-blocks instead
   of informal variables..."
  - Clarify LLM role: "When generating prompts, an LLM can take atomic sub-block values and assemble them into natural language..."
  - When to use which: "Use variables for ad-hoc formulas, use sub-blocks when working with a structured library"

  Should I add a brief intro paragraph before "How Sub-blocks Work" to set context?

  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> Yes that sounds good. But a clarifying question: Can't a subblock also contain variables? You mentioned "..you can use sub-blocks 
instead of informal variables". Or is "..just informal variables"? Whats and INFORMAL variable actually? 

⏺ Good catch! You're exposing unclear thinking.

  Can a sub-block contain variables?
  YES! They're not mutually exclusive:

  [Subject.Description] = {age} {gender} person
    ↑ sub-block (structure)    ↑ variables (placeholders in value)

  So the distinction is:
  - Sub-blocks [Block.SubBlock] = Structural hierarchy (from library)
  - Variables {} = Placeholders within VALUES (guidance for filling)

  They operate at different levels:
  - Sub-blocks = organization/structure
  - Variables = content guidance

  What's "informal" mean?
  I used it poorly. I meant:
  - Variables are just guidance labels
  - They're not "real" structure
  - They disappear when filled

  But that's confusing.

  Better way to say it:
  - Variables = placeholders for guidance (what to write)
  - Sub-blocks = structural paths (where in the hierarchy)

  So I should fix "instead of" to "in addition to":
  "When using a block library, you can use hierarchical sub-blocks. Sub-block values can also contain variables for guidance."

  Make sense? Should I clarify this in the doc?

       46 +    ## Working with Block Libraries
       47 +  
       48 +    When using a **block library** (a structured collection of reusable, organized blocks), you can use hierarchical 
          + sub-blocks to provide more structure and traceability.
       49 +  
       50      ### How Sub-blocks Work
       51    
       52 -    When using a structured block library, blocks can have hierarchical sub-blocks:
       52 +    Sub-blocks use hierarchical paths from the library:
       53    
       54      [Scene.Subjects.Age] = 30s
       55      [Scene.Subjects.Gender] = male
       56    
       57 -    **Sub-blocks vs Variables:**
       58 -    - **Variables `{}`** = Informal placeholders for guidance
       59 -    - **Sub-blocks `[Block.SubBlock]`** = Structured hierarchy from block library
       57 +    **Sub-blocks vs Variables - Different Levels:**
       58 +    - **Variables `{}`** = Placeholders within VALUES (guidance for what to write)
       59 +    - **Sub-blocks `[Block.SubBlock]`** = Structural paths (where in the hierarchy)
       60    
       61 +    **They can work together:**
       62 +    [Subject.Description] = {age} {gender} person
       63 +                             ↑ variables guide the content
       64 +    ↑ sub-block shows library path
       65 +  
       66 +    Variables operate at the **content level**, sub-blocks at the **structural level**.
       67 +  
       68      **Simple/Core blocks** = Leaf nodes in the library that can't be broken down further
       69      - These have **creative freedom** - you write natural language values
       70      - Examples guide you, but you're not constrained

⏺ Update(prompt-output-formats.md)
  ⎿  Updated prompt-output-formats.md with 4 additions and 2 removals                                                             
       76      - **Flat creative blocks** for open-ended descriptions (action, expression)
       77    
       78      **LLM Assembly:**
       79 -    When using sub-blocks, the LLM assembles them into natural descriptive language:
       79 +    When generating prompts with sub-blocks, an LLM can assemble atomic sub-block values 
          +  into natural descriptive language:
       80      - **Sub-blocks** = Atomic values (data structure)
       81 -    - **Main block** = LLM-assembled natural language (resolves phrasing)
       81 +    - **Main block** = LLM-assembled natural language (resolves phrasing conflicts)
       82    
       83      Example:
       84      [Subject] = Person in their 30s
     ...
       87    
       88      The LLM takes `30s` and `male` and creates "Person in their 30s" (not "30s male" or "male in 30s").
       89    
       90 +    This resolves phrasing conflicts - how do you naturally combine "soft", "natural", and "front-lit" into a lighting 
          + description? The LLM handles grammar, word order, and natural flow.

⏺ Done! Updated with:

  ✅ Added "Working with Block Libraries" section - Introduces what a block library is before diving into sub-blocks
  ✅ Clarified variables vs sub-blocks - They work at different levels (content vs structure)
  ✅ Showed they work together - Example of sub-block containing variables
  ✅ Expanded LLM Assembly - Added phrasing conflict example and when this happens
  ✅ Fixed note on formats - Format 4 can also include variables, not "instead of"

  The doc now clearly explains that variables and sub-blocks are complementary, not mutually exclusive.

> Does the doc now makes sense, is consistent and understandable? 

⏺ Reading through it, it's mostly clear but there's one potential confusion:

  Issue: We say variables and sub-blocks "can work together" and show:
  [Subject.Description] = {age} {gender} person

  But this is a TEMPLATE (unfilled). Format 4 (Output Detailed - Sub-blocks) doesn't actually show an example where sub-blocks AND
  variables appear together in filled output.

  Format 4 shows:
  [Subject] = Person in their 30s
    [Subject.Age] = 30s
  (No variables, just sub-blocks with filled values)

  Would it be clearer if Format 4 example included a case where a sub-block value contains variables? Like:
  [Lighting] = soft natural front lighting
    [Lighting.Quality] = soft
    [Lighting.Type] = natural
    [Lighting.Direction] = front-lit
    (assembled from sub-blocks)

  This would show the LLM assembly in action more clearly.

  Or is it fine as-is, and the "work together" example is sufficient even though it's template-only?

  What do you think?

> include if you think it adds value. 

⏺ Yes, it adds value. Let me update Format 4 to include a lighting example that demonstrates LLM assembly:

  ✅ Subject - Simple sub-block assembly (Age + Gender)
  ✅ Setting - Position + Location concatenation✅ Action - Simple block with creative freedom
  ✅ Lighting - Multi-attribute LLM assembly (Quality + Type + Direction → natural phrasing)

  This demonstrates the LLM assembly concept in action - taking atomic values and creating natural language ("soft natural front
  lighting" instead of "soft, natural, front-lit").

  The doc should now be clearer and more complete.

> Do a final review 

⏺ Reading through the doc, here are the issues:

  Major Issues:

  1. "Complete Example" section is incomplete
  - Title says "Complete Example" but only shows Formats 1-3
  - Format 4 is missing from this section
  - Either rename to "Complete Example - Variable-Based Formats" OR add Format 4

  2. Missing high-level guidance
  - Doc explains HOW each format works
  - Doesn't clearly explain WHEN to use variables vs sub-blocks approach
  - A reader might ask: "Should I use a block library or just use variables?"

  Minor Issues:

  3. Two separate examples
  - Format 4 example: "stirring pot" with Lighting
  - Complete Example section: "stirring pot, wiping forehead" without Lighting
  - Slightly confusing to have different versions of "same" prompt

  4. Flow could be smoother
  - Goes: Variables → Block Libraries → Formats
  - Might be clearer: Overview → When to Use What → Variables → Block Libraries → Formats

  Otherwise:

  - ✅ Explanations are clear
  - ✅ Concepts are consistent
  - ✅ No contradictions
  - ✅ Examples are accurate
  - ✅ Sub-blocks vs variables distinction is now clear

  Recommendation:
  1. Add brief "When to Use" guidance at the top
  2. Rename "Complete Example" to be clear it's only formats 1-3

⏺ You're right. I'm overthinking it.

  Honest answer: The doc is fine. It:
  - Explains concepts clearly
  - Is internally consistent
  - Has good examples
  - Makes sense on first read

  The only real issue is the "Complete Example" section doesn't include Format 4, but that's minor - it was written before we added
  Format 4. Not worth changing.

  The doc works. It's done.

⏺ Done! Added Format 4 to the Complete Example section. Now all 4 formats are shown with the same prompt scenario for easy comparison.

> Between those formats which one do you think its best? 

⏺ It depends on your use case:

  For YOUR current workflow (UGC template testing):
  Format 3: Output Detailed - Variables is best because:
  - You can see exactly what filled each placeholder
  - Easy to iterate ("change the {pause} to X")
  - Not overly complex
  - You're using a custom formula, not the full block library yet

  If you were using the full block library:
  Format 4: Output Detailed - Sub-blocks would be better because:
  - Shows which library blocks were used (traceability)
  - Clear hierarchy and structure
  - Shows LLM assembly in action

  For quick review/production:
  Format 2: Output Compact - clean and scannable

  For documentation/sharing:
  Format 1: Template - shows reusable pattern

  My recommendation for you right now: Use Format 3 (Output Detailed - Variables) when I generate prompts for you to review. It gives
  you the visibility you need without unnecessary complexity.

  Sound right?

⏺ You're mostly right, but I think you're missing:

  5. Examples - Proven working prompts
  - The LLM needs to see what "good" looks like
  - Examples show how principles apply in practice
  - "Show, don't just tell"
  - Critical for learning the style/quality bar

  6. Block value library - What works
  - Block library shows STRUCTURE ([Action.State])
  - But what VALUES work? ("on autopilot", "mechanically", "absent-mindedly")
  - This comes from your testing/iteration
  - The vocabulary that actually produces good results

  Maybe:
  7. Template-specific constraints
  - Like "no emotion words for UGC"
  - Rules that apply to specific video concepts
  - (This might be part of "video concept" already)

  The flow would be:
  Principles + Block Library → Formula structure
  Video concept + Constraints → What to generate
  Block values + Examples → How to fill it well
  Format output → How to present it

  So I'd say the critical addition is: Examples of working prompts.

  Without examples, the LLM is guessing. With examples, it learns the pattern.

  What do you think?

> I was reffering to the initial prompts and how to prompt the first time. It needs first to select blocks to craft a formula then I 
will adjust based on testing. 

⏺ Ah! For FIRST-TIME prompt generation, you're right. That's the essentials:

  1. Block library - What blocks are available to choose from
  2. Format output - How to structure and present it
  3. Prompting principles - Rules (descriptive, modality focus, natural language, etc.)
  4. Video concept - What video to create (UGC action, D2C comfort, etc.)

  Maybe also:
  5. Target model/platform - Which model (Veo, etc.) for platform-specific rules

  But that might be captured in "prompting principles" already.

  For the initial attempt (before testing/iteration), that's the core set. The LLM:
  - Uses principles to understand HOW to prompt
  - Uses block library to SELECT which blocks
  - Uses video concept to know WHAT content
  - Uses format to PRESENT the output

  Then YOU test, and the LLM adjusts based on results.

  Yeah, I think you've got it. Anything else feels like it would be post-testing feedback/iteration, not initial generation
  requirements.

  Sound right?

> should you add 

  - Uses principles to understand HOW to prompt
  - Uses block library to SELECT which blocks
  - Uses video concept to know WHAT content
  - Uses format to PRESENT the output

in the v4 guide? 

⏺ Good question. Let me think about where it would fit...

  It could go in:

  Option A: System Hierarchy section - Add it right after the hierarchy diagram as "Using the Framework":
  Using the Framework:
  - Principles → HOW to prompt
  - Block library → SELECT blocks
  - Video concept → WHAT content
  - Format → PRESENT output

  Option B: "Applying This Framework" section - Replace or enhance the current bullet list with this conceptual flow

  But here's the question: The v4 guide is model-agnostic and covers the general framework. This flow feels specific to using a block 
  library to generate prompts - which is more specific than the guide's scope.

  My lean: Maybe this belongs in the Prompt Output Formats doc instead, as a "How to Generate" section? That doc is specifically about
   block-based prompt generation.

  Or do you think it's general enough for v4?

  What's your take - where would this fit best?
