# CLoops Phase 8 Refactor

---

## Context

Refactoring CLoops to hybrid template architecture. Current implementation has hardcoded steps in engine - needs to be template-driven with workflow.ts per template.

## Docs

Read these first:
- Tech Spec v2: `_docs/1_development-docs/core-docs/2-cloops-tech-spec.md`
- Implementation Plan: `_docs/1_development-docs/core-docs/3-cloops-implementation-plan.md`

## Task

Implement Phase 8 step by step.

**For each step:**
1. State which step you're working on
2. Read the current file(s) first
3. Make the changes
4. Run `npm run build` to verify
5. Mark complete in implementation plan

Use `context7` MCP for OpenAI/Replicate API docs if needed.

## Start

Read the tech spec (Section 1 for architecture, Section 4 for template system, Section 8 for services), then begin with Step 8.1.
