# Debug: Jonah and the Whale

## Step 1: Narrative
```
In ancient times, God called Jonah, a prophet, to go to the city of Nineveh and warn the people to turn from their evil ways. But Jonah was afraid and chose to run away. He boarded a ship heading in the opposite direction.

As the ship sailed, a fierce storm arose, threatening to destroy it. The sailors cried out to their gods for help, but nothing changed. Realizing their efforts were in vain, they cast lots to find who was responsible, and the lot fell on Jonah. He confessed that he was fleeing from the Lord and told them to throw him into the sea to calm the storm.

Reluctantly, the sailors threw Jonah overboard, and immediately the sea grew calm. As Jonah sank, a great fish swallowed him whole. Inside the belly of the fish, Jonah prayed and repented.

After three days and nights, the fish released Jonah onto dry land. Grateful for his second chance, Jonah traveled to Nineveh and preached God's message, urging the people to repent, and they listened, turning from their wicked ways. Jonah learned that obedience to God brought peace and transformation.
