## Step 1: Story Narrative (150 words)

"God saw that the world was filled with wickedness and decided to start fresh. He chose Noah, a righteous man, to build a great ark. God gave Noah specific instructions: build it from gopher wood, make it three stories tall, and prepare for the animals. Noah and his family worked for years constructing the massive boat while neighbors mocked them. When the ark was finished, God sent the animals - two of every kind marched toward the ark. Birds flew overhead, lions walked beside lambs, elephants lumbered alongside rabbits. Noah's family guided them all aboard. Then the rains began. Water poured from the sky for forty days and forty nights. The ark floated safely on the rising waters while the flood covered the earth. After many months, the waters receded. Noah sent out a dove that returned with an olive branch. Finally, they landed on dry ground and God placed a rainbow in the sky as His promise."
