## Step 1: Story Narrative (150 words)

[PAGE 1]
Joseph was sold as a slave in Egypt and ended up in prison, though he had done nothing wrong. Two of Pharaoh's servants were thrown into the same prison. One night, both men had troubling dreams they couldn't understand.

[PAGE 2]
Joseph told them God could reveal the meaning. The cupbearer dreamed of three branches bearing grapes, which he pressed into Pharaoh's cup. Joseph explained the dream meant he would be restored in three days. The baker dreamed of three baskets with birds eating the bread. Joseph sadly told him this meant death in three days.

[PAGE 3]
Everything happened exactly as Joseph said. Two years later, Pharaoh had disturbing dreams. The cupbearer remembered Joseph. Pharaoh sent for him. Pharaoh dreamed of seven fat cows eaten by seven thin cows, and seven good grain heads swallowed by seven thin heads.

[PAGE 4]
Joseph told Pharaoh that God was warning of seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine. Pharaoh made Joseph governor of Egypt to prepare for the famine. Joseph stored grain during the good years, saving Egypt and many nations.
