      "narration": "Jared bent over his newborn son and named him Enoch. He whispered a prayer that the boy would know God. Years passed. Jared’s hair turned white, and children and grandchildren filled his tent. Among them, Enoch watched and listened, learning stories of the Creator."

      "narration": "When Enoch himself was older, he held his own baby son, Methuselah. Something changed in his heart. From that time on, people said, “Enoch walks with God.” Day after day he chose God’s ways, spoke with him, and trusted him."

      "narration": "Generations before him had all died. Their resting places lay across the land, each one a marker that life must end. Yet Enoch walked apart, drawn close to the unseen One. A radiant presence seemed to move beside him. One day he walked as before. Then, mid-step, his body faded like light in the morning. His footprints ended. He was simply gone, because God took him."

      "narration": "Methuselah and the family searched the hills. They found no body, only the last print of his foot in the dust. People could only say, “Enoch walked with God, and he was no more.” The mystery of his leaving remained, a quiet promise that God holds the lives of those who walk with him."
