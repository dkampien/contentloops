      "narration": "Eve held her newborn son and smiled through her tears. Adam stood beside her, full of wonder. “With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man,” she said, and they named him Cain. Later, another son was born, Abel, and the first family stood together, small but blessed. Years passed. Cain worked the soil, turning the hard ground. Abel cared for a flock, gently leading his sheep."

      "narration": "One day they came to an altar before the LORD. Abel brought the best of his firstborn lambs, rich and perfect. Cain brought fruits from his fields. A sign of God’s favor rested on Abel’s offering, not on Cain’s. Cain’s face fell. His shoulders sagged, then hardened. In the air around him, a dark, crouching shape hinted at danger. An unseen voice spoke to his heart: “Why are you angry? If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? Sin is crouching at your door. It desires to have you, but you must master it.”"

      "narration": "Later Cain said to Abel, “Come, let us go out to the field.” The brothers walked side by side into the open land. There, under the empty sky, jealousy grew into rage. Cain rose against Abel. In a moment of fierce movement and shadow, the first blood of man spilled onto the ground. Afterward, Cain stood alone. The field was silent."

      "narration": "Then the LORD spoke, “Where is Abel your brother?” Cain lifted his eyes, defiant yet afraid. “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?” The earth at his feet seemed to cry. “What have you done?” God said. “Your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground. Now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. When you work the soil, it will no longer yield its strength. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.” Cain trembled. “My punishment is more than I can bear. Today You drive me from the land, and from Your presence I will be hidden. Whoever finds me will kill me.” But the LORD answered, “Not so.” He set a mysterious mark on Cain, a sign that anyone who harmed him would suffer greater judgment. In the distance, other people watched with fear and wonder. Cain turned away from the place where God’s presence had been near. He walked toward the land of Nod, east of Eden, the ground dry beneath his feet. Marked yet spared, he went out as a lonely wanderer, carrying the memory of his brother and the weight of his own sin."
