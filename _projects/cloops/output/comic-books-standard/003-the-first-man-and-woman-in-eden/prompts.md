# The First Man and Woman in Eden

## Narrative
```
The earth is bare and quiet. From the dust of the ground, God shapes the first man. He leans close and breathes into the man’s nostrils the breath of life. The man opens his eyes and lives.

God plants a garden in Eden. The empty land changes. Soft soil, bright flowers, and many trees appear. In the center stand the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. A clear river flows out and becomes four great streams.

God places the man in the garden to work it and care for it. God says, “You may eat from every tree in the garden, but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If you eat from it you will surely die.” That tree stands apart, marked as dangerous.

God brings animals and birds to the man. One by one he names them, yet he finds no partner like himself.

God sends the man into a deep sleep. God gently takes a rib from his side and forms it into a woman, a shining work of His hands. God brings her to the man. He cries with joy, “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.”

The man and the woman stand together in the garden, united as one. They are naked and feel no shame, surrounded by the beauty of Eden and the life God has given them.

PAGE 1
A comic book page with three tall vertical panels, in a children's book illustration style with bold ink lines and flat, vibrant colors.

Panel 1: Extreme wide shot of a barren landscape with cracked, colorless ground stretching to the horizon under a pale, still sky, the tiny human-shaped form of rising dust centered low in the frame; the camera is level and distant, with soft, even daylight casting faint shadows across the empty land.

Panel 2: Medium shot from slightly below showing a luminous robed figure kneeling over a half-formed man made of dust, the figure’s strong hands pressing and shaping the man’s dusty chest and arms as loose particles drift from his limbs; the background is simple bare ground, with a strong sidelight catching the floating dust in the air.

Panel 3: Close-up from the man’s side of his motionless body on the ground as the luminous figure leans close above him, the figure’s face in soft focus near the top of the frame while the man’s nostrils and gently rising chest are sharply in focus; a narrow beam of bright light cuts across his face and just-opening eyes, and a small speech balloon beside his mouth reads “*gasp*” in clear lettering.

PAGE 2
A comic book page with three tall vertical panels, in a children's book illustration style with bold ink lines and flat, vibrant colors.

Panel 1: High, slightly tilted shot of once-barren ground as a wave of fresh growth spreads outward, with patches of soft green grass, dark moist soil, and sprouting plants rolling across the cracked earth from the lower left to the upper right; gentle daylight brightens the new greens while the untouched dry ground remains dull.

Panel 2: Wide shot from behind the bare-shouldered man at waist level as he stands small among a lush garden of bright flowers, tall fruit trees, and thick foliage, his silhouette framed against layered colorful plants and trunks filling the background; warm sunlight filters down through the leaves in soft beams.

Panel 3: Low-angle shot of the garden’s center where two distinct trees dominate the foreground on either side, one vibrant and heavy with fruit, the other taller with slightly twisted branches and darker leaves, while a clear river runs between them and splits into four shining streams that wind toward the bright horizon; crisp sunlight glitters on the water’s surface.

PAGE 3
A comic book page with three tall vertical panels, in a children's book illustration style with bold ink lines and flat, vibrant colors.

Panel 1: Ground-level medium shot of the man kneeling in the garden, his bare hands gently loosening soil around a small green plant in the foreground, with soft-focus fruit trees and colorful flowers surrounding him behind; warm daylight creates gentle highlights on the leaves and his skin.

Panel 2: Three-quarter view from just behind the man’s shoulder as he stands beside a luminous robed figure facing a tall, distinct tree with a slightly twisted trunk and unusual fruit, the tree centered in the frame with a thin ring of bare soil around its base; its canopy casts a deeper shadow than the nearby sunlit trees, and a speech balloon near the robed figure reads “Do not eat from this tree.”

Panel 3: Medium-wide shot at the man’s eye level as he sits on a smooth rock in the garden, a gentle line of animals curving around him in a loose arc: a large lion in the near foreground, a deer just beyond, small creatures at his feet, and birds perched on his outstretched arm; soft sunlight lights their fur and feathers, and a speech balloon near his face reads “None of these is like me.”

PAGE 4
A comic book page with three tall vertical panels, in a children's book illustration style with bold ink lines and flat, vibrant colors.

Panel 1: Medium shot from above showing the man lying diagonally across soft grass beside a sturdy tree trunk, his eyes closed and body relaxed in deep sleep, with dappled light from leaves overhead creating gentle patterns on his bare skin and the ground; the surrounding garden foliage is calm and still.

Panel 2: Three-quarter view of God shaping the woman from a softly glowing rib drawn from the man’s side, her completed form standing in the foreground while God’s hands rest near her shoulders; the sleeping man lies smaller and slightly blurred behind them on the grass, a narrow band of pale light linking his side to her back, all lit by warm, focused radiance.

Panel 3: Frontal medium shot of the now-awake man and woman standing unclothed yet simply and modestly stylized, centered and facing each other as they hold hands; trees and flowers arc above them to form a natural frame, while a bright strip of the river runs horizontally behind their legs, catching the sunlight, and a speech balloon near the man’s mouth reads “Bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh.”

## Thumbnail
```
A vertical portrait comic book cover, children's book illustration style with bold ink lines and flat colors, vibrant and dramatic. In the center foreground, God stands on a small rise, a warm, gentle, robed figure glowing softly with golden light, one hand extended as if proudly presenting Eve to Adam. Eve, with long flowing dark hair and simple leafy garment, steps forward shyly but joyfully from God’s side, reaching out toward Adam. Adam, strong and kind-looking with short dark hair and a simple leafy garment, stands opposite her with arms slightly open, eyes wide in wonder and happiness. Around their feet is lush green grass sprinkled with colorful flowers; behind them stretches the Garden of Eden, filled with bright fruit trees, a sparkling blue river winding through the scene, and soft rolling hills. Friendly animals—like a lion lying peacefully, a deer, some birds perched on branches, and a small monkey on a tree—watch curiously, emphasizing harmony and peace. In the background, slightly to one side, the Tree of Life rises tall and majestic with radiant golden fruit glowing softly, while the sky above is a rich blue with warm sunset tones near the horizon, rays of light streaming down to spotlight the trio. The composition is dynamic but clear, with strong silhouettes and expressive faces, aiming for an epic, storybook cover feeling suitable for children. Bold text at top: "THE FIRST MAN AND WOMAN IN EDEN" in thick blocky sans-serif font, white letters with heavy black outline stroke, comic book title style, all caps. Epic, storybook cover aesthetic.
