# The Six Days of Creation

## Narrative
```
In the beginning, there was only a deep, silent darkness. Waters covered everything, formless and empty, and the Spirit of God hovered over the surface like a watchful presence. All was still, waiting.

Then God spoke, “Let there be light.” At once, light burst into the darkness. Day and night parted from each other, and the first great division of creation began.

God spoke again, and the waters pulled back. Dry land rose up while seas gathered on every side. At His word the ground broke into life, covered in grass, flowers, and trees heavy with fruit.

God set great lights in the sky: the sun to rule the day, the moon to rule the night, and countless stars to mark seasons and years over the young earth.

He filled the seas with huge creatures and darting fish, and the sky with birds of every color. Then He made animals to walk the land.

Last, God formed humanity, male and female, in His own image. He blessed them and gave them rule over all He had made.

God looked over the wide, living world. Light and sky, land and sea, plants, stars, animals, and people. He saw everything that He had made, and it was very good.

PAGE 1
A comic book page with 3 vertically stacked panels in a children’s book illustration style, bold ink lines, flat colors, vibrant and accessible.
Panel 1 shows an extreme wide shot from a straight-on angle where almost the entire frame is pure black, with only a narrow horizontal band of barely visible, dimly lit rippling water textures along the very bottom, lit by the faintest cool ambient glow; a small narration box floats in the darkness near the top.
Panel 2 is a medium shot from a straight-on angle of dark, gently rippling water filling the lower frame, with a soft, cloud-like luminous form hovering just inches above the surface, its glow creating a small circle of light and gentle concentric ripples beneath it, surrounded by deep shadow and subtle reflections.
Panel 3 is a low-angle close-up where the glowing mist-like presence fills the upper part of the frame against heavy darkness, a thin, bright line of light beginning to pierce in from one side and outlining tiny silhouetted waves below; a clear speech balloon near the light bears the words “Let there be light.”

PAGE 2
A comic book page with 3 vertically stacked panels in a children’s book illustration style, bold ink lines, flat colors, vibrant and accessible.
Panel 1 is a wide shot from a straight-on angle of a mostly abstract space where a diagonal swath of blinding white-gold light tears across the page, sharply dividing the frame into a brilliant side and a deep black side, the crisp luminous edge glowing intensely; a narration box sits near the top border of the panel.
Panel 2 is a distant view from a high angle of a blue, cloud-swirled planet hanging in dark space, one hemisphere brightly lit by a strong off-frame sun and the other in shadow, a clear vertical curve marking the day-night division, with tiny star specks around; a speech balloon near the planet contains the words “Waters, pull back. Land, arise.”
Panel 3 is a low-angle ground-level shot where ocean waters dramatically retreat left and right, revealing a central ridge of dark, wet soil that instantly sprouts bright green grass, colorful flowers, and tall fruit trees heavy with hanging fruit, all under clear warm daylight from above and a soft blue sky in the background.

PAGE 3
A comic book page with 3 vertically stacked panels in a children’s book illustration style, bold ink lines, flat colors, vibrant and accessible.
Panel 1 uses a split composition from a straight-on angle: on the left, a close, radiant yellow sun blazes in a bright blue daytime sky; on the right, a large pale moon and dense white stars glow in a rich indigo night sky, both halves sharing a continuous curved strip of the earth’s edge along the bottom under simple directional light from each celestial body.
Panel 2 is a wide underwater shot from a slightly upward angle where deep blue water fades darker with depth, strong sunbeams slant down from the bright surface at the top, huge whales and other large sea creatures glide mid-frame as dark, graceful silhouettes, and shimmering schools of small colorful fish weave in the foreground; a small narration box near the lower corner reads “He filled the seas with creatures.”
Panel 3 is a medium-wide shot from a slightly elevated angle of a sunlit landscape with grassy plains and a few rocky outcrops in the lower half, where lions, deer, elephants, and other land animals walk or stand, while the upper half of the panel is crowded with flocks of multicolored birds in flight against a clear bright sky, all bathed in warm daylight.

PAGE 4
A comic book page with 3 vertically stacked panels in a children’s book illustration style, bold ink lines, flat colors, vibrant and accessible.
Panel 1 is a medium shot from a straight-on angle of a lush garden clearing with soft green grass and scattered plants, centered on two human forms rising upright from a ring of disturbed soil, their bodies transitioning from earthy tones to natural skin, wrapped by swirling particles of glowing dust in warm golden light.
Panel 2 is a wide shot from a slightly low angle positioned behind the man and woman’s shoulders, their simple unclothed silhouettes standing on a small grassy rise in the foreground while an expansive vista of rivers, forests, mountains, and distant seas stretches out below under a bright blue sky; a speech balloon above them contains the words “Be fruitful. Rule over the earth.”
Panel 3 is a very high, pulled-back view from above showing the gentle curvature of the earth’s horizon with layered clouds, green landmasses, and blue seas below, small groups of animals and birds visible on the surface, the tiny human pair barely visible amid the scene, and a sky that transitions from warm daylight near the sun to darker blue with emerging stars and a pale moon, all touched by a soft golden glow; a narration box near the edge says “It was very good.”

## Thumbnail
```
A vertical portrait comic book cover, children's book illustration style with bold ink lines and flat colors, vibrant and dramatic. In the center, on a lush green hill, a radiant, gentle Creator figure stands with arms outstretched, face kind and glowing with warm golden light, wearing simple flowing robes that swirl slightly as if in a soft breeze. Beside Him stand a newly created man and woman, smiling in wonder, reaching out toward the world around them. Around the hill, a vivid Eden landscape bursts with life: colorful birds swoop through a bright blue sky, a sun with soft rays shines above, fluffy white clouds drift by, tall trees heavy with fruit frame the sides, rivers of sparkling blue water wind through the scene, and a variety of animals—lions resting peacefully, deer, rabbits, and birds—gather calmly near the humans. In the distant sky, the faint suggestion of stars, moon, and sun together hints at the earlier days of creation. The colors are rich and saturated, with strong shadows and highlights giving a dramatic, epic, yet friendly storybook feel. Bold text at top: "THE SIX DAYS OF CREATION" in thick blocky sans-serif font, white letters with heavy black outline stroke, comic book title style, all caps. Epic, storybook cover aesthetic.
