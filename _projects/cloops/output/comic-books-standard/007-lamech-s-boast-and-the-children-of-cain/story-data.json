      "narration": "Cain walked east from Eden with a restless heart. In a wide plain he stopped and began to build. Rough walls of stone and mud rose slowly. Simple houses took shape. Men carried bricks, women shaped mortar. Cain watched with hard, proud eyes. When the work was done, he named the new city after his son, Enoch."

      "narration": "Time passed, and sons were born: Enoch, then Irad, then Mehujael, then Methusael. From Methusael came Lamech, strong and fierce, standing with his two wives, Adah and Zillah."

      "narration": "Adah’s son Jabal lived among tents in an open land. Flocks of sheep and goats surrounded him. He taught people to move with their herds and live as wanderers. His brother Jubal sat with simple harps and flutes, showing others how to shape sound into song. People gathered, listening with wonder. Zillah’s son Tubal cain worked by a roaring fire, hammering glowing bronze and iron into sharp tools, while his sister Naamah watched the sparks fly."

      "narration": "One night Lamech called Adah and Zillah. In the dark he spoke in a proud, harsh voice. “I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me. If Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy sevenfold.” The women’s faces grew tight with fear. Around them, the city lights flickered. Human skill was growing, but in Cain’s line, so was human violence."
