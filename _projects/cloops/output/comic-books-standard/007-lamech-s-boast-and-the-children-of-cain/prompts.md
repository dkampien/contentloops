# Lamech’s Boast and the Children of Cain

## Narrative
```
Cain walked east from Eden with a restless heart. In a wide plain he stopped and began to build. Rough walls of stone and mud rose slowly. Simple houses took shape. Men carried bricks, women shaped mortar. Cain watched with hard, proud eyes. When the work was done, he named the new city after his son, Enoch.

Time passed, and sons were born: Enoch, then Irad, then Mehujael, then Methusael. From Methusael came Lamech, strong and fierce, standing with his two wives, Adah and Zillah.

Adah’s son Jabal lived among tents in an open land. Flocks of sheep and goats surrounded him. He taught people to move with their herds and live as wanderers. His brother Jubal sat with simple harps and flutes, showing others how to shape sound into song. People gathered, listening with wonder. Zillah’s son Tubal cain worked by a roaring fire, hammering glowing bronze and iron into sharp tools, while his sister Naamah watched the sparks fly.

One night Lamech called Adah and Zillah. In the dark he spoke in a proud, harsh voice. “I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me. If Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy sevenfold.”

The women’s faces grew tight with fear. Around them, the city lights flickered. Human skill was growing, but in Cain’s line, so was human violence.

Comic book page with 3 vertically stacked panels in a children’s book illustration style, bold ink lines and flat, vibrant, accessible colors.

Panel 1: Wide establishing shot from behind Cain at eye level, his small lone figure with dark, shoulder-length hair in a rough earth-toned tunic walking away from the soft green edge of Eden into a vast, dry, cracked plain, the sun-bleached empty horizon stretching ahead under a pale blue sky; a narration caption at the top reads "Cain walked east from Eden with a restless heart."

Panel 2: Medium-wide shot from a slightly raised angle over the middle of the plain, showing low half-built stone-and-mud walls and scattered simple wooden house frames, with a few men carrying bricks and women kneeling to shape mortar between the stones under a bright high sun, loose piles of stone and tools lying on the ground; a narration caption says "In a wide plain he stopped and began to build. Rough walls of stone and mud rose slowly. Simple houses took shape."

Panel 3: Low-angle medium-close shot of Cain in the foreground, his sturdy figure turned toward a cluster of simple stone houses and enclosing walls now mostly complete behind him, tired workers sitting or reclining along the ground and doorways, late-afternoon golden light outlining the city’s rough rooflines against a warming sky; a narration caption near the top reads "When the work was done, he named the new city after his son, Enoch.", and a speech balloon from Cain’s raised arm says "This city shall be called Enoch."

### Page 2
```
Comic book page with 3 vertically stacked panels in a children’s book illustration style, bold ink lines and flat, vibrant, accessible colors.

Panel 1: Tiered composition at eye level inside the city, with four male figures overlapping diagonally from foreground to background to suggest generations—Enoch nearest, then Irad, Mehujael, and Methusael furthest back—each in simple tunics with slightly differing ages, hair, and beards, standing before low stone city walls and a few plain towers under clear daylight; a narration caption along the top reads "Time passed, and sons were born: Enoch, then Irad, then Mehujael, then Methusael."

Panel 2: Medium shot at eye level on a simple stone-paved street between rough houses, older Methusael in three-quarter view with lined face and graying beard standing beside a younger, broad-shouldered Lamech, who is slightly in front of him, arms relaxed but solid, the city street receding in perspective behind them in bright daytime light; a narration caption near the bottom says "From Methusael came Lamech."

Panel 3: Frontal medium-close shot centered on adult Lamech, broad-shouldered and armed with a simple spear or sword at his side, filling most of the frame, with Adah on one side and Zillah on the other in distinct patterned robes and head coverings, all three standing firmly before an expanding city skyline of more numerous stone buildings under a darkening evening sky; a narration caption at the top reads "Lamech, strong and fierce, stood with his two wives, Adah and Zillah.", and a speech balloon from Lamech says "I stand as son of Cain’s line."

### Page 3
```
Comic book page with 3 vertically stacked panels in a children’s book illustration style, bold ink lines and flat, vibrant, accessible colors.

Panel 1: Wide shot from a slightly raised angle over an open landscape, with scattered simple tents arranged in loose rows and winding paths of sheep and goats moving between them, Jabal standing central and larger in the foreground in a travel-worn robe, one arm extended toward people leading the animals across the grass and dust; a narration caption along the top reads "Adah’s son Jabal lived among tents in an open land. Flocks of sheep and goats surrounded him. He taught people to move with their herds and live as wanderers."

Panel 2: Medium-close shot focused on Jubal seated on a low stool, his hands on a simple harp in the foreground, a few flutes and another small harp laid out beside him on the ground, with listeners sitting in a soft, slightly out-of-focus semicircle behind him, faces turned toward him, all lit by warm late-day light; a narration caption says "His brother Jubal sat with simple harps and flutes, showing others how to shape sound into song. People gathered, listening with wonder.", and a speech balloon from one onlooker in the background reads "Listen—he turns breath into music."

Panel 3: Low-angle close shot inside a darkened workshop, emphasizing a glowing orange metal blade on an anvil surrounded by flying sparks, Tubal-cain’s strong arm and raised hammer visible above it, while Naamah stands just behind and to the side, her face and hair lit by the roaring furnace glow in the background; a narration caption along the top reads "Zillah’s son Tubal-cain worked by a roaring fire, hammering glowing bronze and iron into sharp tools, while his sister Naamah watched the sparks fly.", and a speech balloon from Naamah says "Your fire shapes stone into strength."

### Page 4
```
Comic book page with 3 vertically stacked panels in a children’s book illustration style, bold ink lines and flat, vibrant, accessible colors.

Panel 1: Medium-wide shot at night from behind Adah and Zillah as they approach, their cloaked figures in the foreground, with Lamech framed in the doorway of a simple stone house ahead, a single torch beside him casting flickering orange light and long shadows across the ground, the sky above deep and starless and a few dim city lights visible in the distance; a narration caption at the top reads "One night Lamech called Adah and Zillah. Around them, the city lights flickered."

Panel 2: Tight three-figure composition at chest height, Lamech standing very close to Adah and Zillah, his face partially lit by strong side light from a nearby unseen torch, one hand lifted as he speaks, while the women’s faces are tense and still, most of the stone wall and background falling into deep shadow; a narration caption beside them says "In the dark he spoke in a proud, harsh voice.", and two speech balloons from Lamech read "I have killed a man for wounding me." and "If Cain is avenged, I far more so."

Panel 3: Close shot over Lamech’s shoulder, his head and dark silhouette blurred in the extreme foreground, with Adah and Zillah filling the frame, their brows drawn and mouths tight, framed against a softly blurred backdrop of scattered, uneven city lights and rooftops against the dark sky; a narration caption along the bottom reads "The women’s faces grew tight with fear. Human skill was growing, but in Cain’s line, so was human violence."

## Thumbnail

A vertical portrait comic book cover, children's book illustration style with bold ink lines and flat colors, vibrant and dramatic. In the foreground, a powerful, intimidating man with dark beard and rough clothes, Lamech, stands on a rocky rise, one arm raised in furious boast, the other gripping a heavy, blood-stained staff, his face twisted in pride as he shouts. At his feet, a fallen young man lies partly in shadow, hinting at violence without gore. Just below Lamech, two women in simple ancient robes, Adah and Zillah, look up at him with a mix of fear and sorrow, clutching their children close. In the midground, to the left, the Children of Cain are shown as early city builders: one son hammers glowing metal on an anvil, sparks flying; another tends a small herd of animals; to the right, a musician plays a harp-like instrument while another beats a hand drum, their music contrasting with Lamech’s dark boast. In the background, an early walled city of stone and wood rises under a burning orange sky, suggesting a growing, restless civilization marked by violence and artistry. Dramatic lighting emphasizes Lamech and his wives, with long shadows stretching toward the viewer, and stylized dust and embers in the air add intensity, all rendered in a bold, kid-friendly comic style.

Bold text at top: "LAMECH’S BOAST AND THE CHILDREN OF CAIN" in thick blocky sans-serif font, white letters with heavy black outline stroke, comic book title style, all caps.

Epic, storybook cover aesthetic.
