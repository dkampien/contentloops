# Confrontation in the Garden

## Narrative
```
The garden is quiet in the cool of the day. Adam and Eve crouch among thick trees, hearts pounding. The joy of Eden is gone, replaced by fear. They clutch leaves to their bodies, trying to cover their nakedness.

The sound of the LORD’s presence moves through the garden. Branches whisper. Light and shadow shift. A powerful voice calls, “Where are you?” The words roll through the trees and find them where they hide.

Adam trembles. At last he steps out, still half hidden, covering himself. “I heard You in the garden,” he says, “and I was afraid, because I was naked. So I hid.”

God’s voice is firm and heavy. “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree I commanded you not to eat from?” Behind them the forbidden tree stands, its fruit still hanging.

Adam’s eyes dart to Eve. Fear twists into blame. He points toward her. “The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate.” Eve’s face fills with shock and shame.

The LORD turns to Eve with solemn intensity. “What is this you have done?”

Eve cannot lift her eyes. She gestures toward the serpent, coiled nearby in the shadows. “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”

The garden is silent. Their excuses hang in the air, but nothing can hide the truth. They have disobeyed. Now they must face the holy God who walks in their broken paradise.

PAGE 1
Comic book page with 3 vertical panels in a children’s book illustration style, bold ink lines, flat colors, vibrant and accessible.

Panel 1: In a lush forested garden, a low, close view from behind dense foliage frames Adam and Eve crouched small between massive dark tree trunks. They press their bodies into the deep shadow of the undergrowth, clutching broad green leaves against their chests and waists, eyes wide and glancing upward. Soft, cool daylight filters through the canopy as dappled patches of light fall around them but leave their faces in shade.

Panel 2: A wide shot looks straight down a tree-lined path in the same garden, trunks and bushes forming a natural tunnel. At the center of the path a soft, warm glow moves forward, brushing nearby leaves so they tilt and bend slightly, with dust motes and thin shafts of light shimmering in its wake. The glowing area suggests an unseen presence, and a clear speech bubble emerges from its center reading, “Adam, where are you now?”. The surrounding greenery is cooler and darker, emphasizing the traveling light.

Panel 3: From high above the trees, the camera looks down through overlapping branches onto Adam and Eve huddled at the base of a trunk. A bright diagonal band of light cuts across their bodies while the ground and foliage behind them fall into deeper shade. Adam and Eve curl inward, gripping their leaf coverings tighter, their shoulders raised. Stylized curved lines, like soft sound waves, travel through the trees toward them, slightly bending nearby leaves as they pass.

PAGE 2
Comic book page with 3 vertical panels in a children’s book illustration style, bold ink lines, flat colors, vibrant and accessible.

Panel 1: In the garden among tall trees, a medium shot from slightly below shows Adam edging out from behind a thick trunk. One shoulder and leg remain in deep shadow while the rest of his body steps into a strong beam of warm light. He clutches leafy coverings tightly to his waist and chest, head bowed, brows drawn together, mouth open as he speaks. A speech bubble near his face reads, “I was afraid, so I hid.” The background foliage is softly blurred.

Panel 2: A wide, symmetrical view of the garden places Adam small on the left side of the frame, standing on grassy ground with trees receding behind him. On the right side, a blazing vertical pillar of light rises from the earth, too bright to reveal any figure inside, casting long rays across the scene. Centered in the distant background between Adam and the light stands the forbidden tree, its trunk straight and strong, branches heavy with large, distinct, untouched fruit. The garden plants around it are lush but quieter in color, directing attention to the pillar and the tree.

Panel 3: A three-quarter shot shows Adam fully in view in the foreground, torso twisted as he turns toward Eve. One arm extends sharply, finger pointing past the viewer’s left toward her, his other hand still gripping leaves at his waist. Eve stands just behind and slightly to the side of him, in softer light, one hand pressed to her mouth, eyes wide and shiny, shoulders drawn inward. In the darker lower corner near the roots of a tree, the coiled silhouette of a serpent is barely visible, its body forming a dark curve against the ground. A speech bubble by Adam’s face reads, “The woman gave it to me.”

PAGE 3
Comic book page with 3 vertical panels in a children’s book illustration style, bold ink lines, flat colors, vibrant and accessible.

Panel 1: In the shadowed garden, a medium shot centers Eve standing slightly apart from Adam, who appears farther back and more obscured among the trees. A bright vertical beam of light has shifted to fall directly on Eve, outlining her figure while leaving the background trunks and Adam in deeper shade. Her head is bowed, long hair falling forward, shoulders slightly hunched, hands holding leaf coverings close. From the glowing column to one side of her, a speech bubble appears reading, “Eve, what is this you’ve done?”.

Panel 2: From a low, ground-level angle, the viewer looks across fallen leaves and roots toward the base of a tree. From the top edge of the panel, Eve’s bare feet and lower legs enter the frame, and her arm extends downward and sideways, a finger pointing toward the ground. The serpent lies coiled at the base of the trunk in sharp focus, its dark green and brown scales catching faint glints of light along its curves, yellow eyes visible. Around them the soil and roots fall into dimmer light. A speech bubble near Eve’s lowered head, partly offscreen, reads, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”

Panel 3: A distant, elevated wide shot reveals a broad view of the garden with tall trees, thick bushes, and a grassy clearing. Adam and Eve appear small and separated on opposite sides of the clearing, turned slightly toward a towering vertical glow that rises between and above them, the bright presence dominating the center of the frame. No animals move in the scene; branches and leaves appear still, with no motion lines. The outer edges of the panel fade into a muted, darker vignette, focusing attention on the two small figures and the bright column of light in their broken paradise.

A vertical portrait comic book cover, children's book illustration style with bold ink lines and flat colors, vibrant and dramatic. In a moonlit garden at night, Jesus stands calmly at the center of a stone path among dark olive trees, his white robe and soft blue cloak glowing against the deep indigo sky, a warm golden light subtly outlining his figure. In the foreground, a line of armored soldiers in dark red and bronze with stern faces and raised torches push forward from the right, their firelight casting dramatic shadows across twisted tree trunks and the ground. On the left, a troubled Judas in a brown cloak steps slightly ahead of the soldiers, one hand lifted hesitantly toward Jesus as if about to betray him, his face torn between guilt and determination. Just behind Jesus, a protective disciple in a simple earth-toned robe grips the hilt of a short sword, half-drawn with a glinting blade, his expression angry and afraid, hinting at the coming clash. The garden is dense with looming olive branches that frame the scene like a natural archway, leaves lit by flickering torchlight, while distant city walls sit low on the dark horizon. The lighting is dramatic, with strong contrasts between warm torchlight and cool moonlight, emphasizing Jesus’ peaceful, resolute expression in the tense standoff, capturing the single moment just before the arrest begins. Bold text at top: "CONFRONTATION IN THE GARDEN" in thick blocky sans-serif font, white letters with heavy black outline stroke, comic book title style, all caps. Epic, storybook cover aesthetic.
