# Dump 2

- uses chat comletions
- script generator only takes into account one template? 
Given we're at 113k/200k tokens (56%) and have completed 5 of 8 phases, I'm in good shape to continue. Let me proceed with Phase 6 - Video
  Generation (Veo 3.1 + Frame Chaining). This is a significant phase with multiple steps. Let me start with Step 6.1.


- Fiecare cycly are un bottleneck teoretic de implemenntare in limita a context window + buffer

- Add a final step when it goes against the implementation plan and what it implemented and checks how accurate it implemented. The problem is that it might not accurately followed the plan. 

Another problem can be that it did not reflect properly my decisions in the implementation plan. Upper funnel 

So the funnel of accuracy
- How well it translates my decisions and specs from me to exploration, requirements and implementation plan docs. 
- How well it follows the implememntation plan 

Needing external docs
Manaigng context window

Stick to the original plan
