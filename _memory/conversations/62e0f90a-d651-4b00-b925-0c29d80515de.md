# Synthesizing Project Memory and Updating Documentation

## Context
Ran `/synthesize` command to consolidate all conversation summaries, documentation, and codebase state into updated master memory. Also updated CLAUDE.md to reflect current SoulStream collaboration status and project evolution.

## Tracking Points

**Status: Master Memory Fully Synthesized**
- ✅ Consolidated 2 conversation summaries (memory system design, comic template work)
- ✅ Integrated recent work: Comic book template system with 2 complete stories
- ✅ Updated current status: Phase 1 active (was "negotiating")
- ✅ Added comic template production details, model testing results, style consistency challenges
- ✅ Memory system status: All commands complete (was "building /synthesize")

**Discovery: Comic Template Work Since Last Synthesis**
- Complete production workflow documented (4-step page-first approach)
- Block library converted from markdown to JSON format
- Template-specific blocks strategy established (lean main library + template testing)
- 2 complete Bible stories (David & Goliath, Noah's Ark) with full block mappings
- Model testing: seedream-4 (100% success) vs nano-banana (50% success)
- Style consistency identified as blocker, proposed solution: dedicated style reference image

**Decision: CLAUDE.md Updated to Reflect Reality**
- Changed title: "Bible Content Video Generation POC" → "SoulStream/Bible Chat Content Generation"
- Added Project Status section with collaboration details (3900 EUR + 200 EUR testing/month)
- Updated to reflect paid client work vs POC concept
- Added evolution timeline and current objectives
- Kept concise (55 lines) as requested

**Pattern: Synthesis Workflow Validated**
- Full synthesis process works end-to-end (gather summaries → scan docs → check git → cross-reference → synthesize → present → save)
- Successfully captured evolution and changes over time
- Master memory now includes both video templates and comic template work
- Clear separation of content types: ad creatives (video) vs in-app content (comics)

**Learning: Project Evolution Captured Clearly**
- Journey visible: POC concept → trial → paid collaboration → multi-format content system
- Content types expanded: Video ads → Video ads + in-app comics
- Block library evolution tracked: Markdown → JSON, template-specific strategy
- File organization changes documented

**User Confirmation: Project Structure**
- Main project = SoulStream/Bible Chat collaboration (all work here)
- Startup House = Future separate project (will create new folder when started)
- Current small objective clearly stated in CLAUDE.md: Find winning creatives → automate for AdLoop integration
