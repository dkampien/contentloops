# Prompt Framework Documentation Refinement & Custom GPT Setup

## Context
Comprehensive review and refinement of prompt generation framework documentation (v2), including fixing inconsistencies, improving structure, and preparing system prompt for Custom GPT implementation.

## Tracking Points

**Documentation Structure - Final State:**
- Decision: Two-doc system maintained - `prompt-formula-framework-v2.md` (methodology) + `prompt-generation-guide-v5.md` (application)
- Framework is standalone, Guide references Framework (one-way dependency)
- Guide designed for future expansion with multiple modality coverage

**Framework v2 Updates:**
- Decision: camelCase notation for all blocks (`[subject.physicalFeatures]` not `[Subject.PhysicalFeatures]`)
- Discovery: "Core blocks" = blocks that can't be meaningfully subdivided further (have creative freedom)
- Decision: Assembly rules integrated into Formula Construction Process (step 5) - not LLM-specific, it's core methodology
- Decision: Block Organization Principles merged into step 4 of construction process
- Decision: "Key Principle" (selective block usage) integrated into step 2 of construction process
- Clarification: Hierarchy depth recommended at 4 levels or less for maintainability
- Addition: Format 5 (JSON Nested) added for machine-readable output - pure block structure only, metadata kept external

**Critical Correction - Narrative vs Descriptive:**
- Discovery: Previous assumption was WRONG - narrative style IS compatible with blocks
- Corrected: Narrative vs Descriptive = how you WRITE block values, not the structure
- Both phrasing styles work with block-based formulas
- Guide v5 updated to reflect this (removed "narrative → freeform prompts" statement)

**Custom GPT System Prompt:**
- Decision: System prompt should reference framework docs, not duplicate methodology
- Approach: Default behavior instead of asking questions at session start
- Defaults: Output Compact format, descriptive phrasing (unless sequential content)
- User can override by specifying format or phrasing in their request
- Description field (300 char limit): Quick onboarding showing what first message should be

**Open Questions/Future Work:**
- Noted: Narrative-style sequential prompts (like Maserati example) may need separate exploration
- JSON prompts for complex narratives could be alternate approach to explore later
